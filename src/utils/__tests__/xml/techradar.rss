<p><strong>Organize your media collection and stream it across your home network</strong></p><p><a href="http://www.techradar.com/reviews/kodi">Kodi</a> is less of a media player in the traditional sense of the word, and more of a home media hub &#x2013; something given away by the fact that this used to be known as XBMC (Xbox Media Center). It&apos;s available for just about every platform out there, and it&apos;s even possible to buy dedicated Kodi boxes that can be plugged straight into a TV or monitor.</p><p>Kodi will play almost all local and network video and audio files, and can also stream content from the web. If you have a large video collection, Kodi will help you to organize it neatly, and will download posters, movie and show information in addition to the usual metadata.</p><p>Kodi functions as a PVR, supports a wide range of remote controls, and can be extended through the use of plugins. In short, it has everything you could want from a free media player, though newcomers might find the learning curve a bit steep.</p><p><strong>Review and where to download: </strong><a href="http://www.techradar.com/reviews/kodi"><strong>Kodi</strong></a></p>

<h3>4. <a href="http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/software/audio-software/gom-player-review-1328690/review">GOM Player</a></h3>
<p><strong>An excellent media player that will stand you in good stead for the future</strong></p><p>The claim that <a href="http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/software/audio-software/gom-player-review-1328690/review">GOM Player</a> is the &quot;only media player you need&quot; may seem a little grand, it&apos;s probably not far off the mark. There&apos;s great support for a range of media formats out of the box, and if you stumble across a file that can&#x2019;t be played, the player will try to track down the necessary codec for you.</p><p>GOM Player supports 360-degree video, which might be a little niche, but is only going to gain popularity, and there are excellent control and tweaking options to ensure that you get the best possible entertainment experience.</p><p>Pay attention while installing GOM Player, because you&apos;ll be prompted to install a browser extension. Despite appearances, dismissing this option won&apos;t cancel the installation. You&apos;ll also have to learn to ignore the ads that appear in the program, or find an alternative if you can&apos;t.</p><p><strong>Review and where to download: </strong><a href="http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/software/audio-software/gom-player-review-1328690/review"><strong>GOM Player</strong></a></p>

<p><strong>A lightweight free media player designed specifically for video</strong></p><p><a href="https://mpc-hc.org/downloads/" target="_blank">Media Player Classic Home Cinema</a> is so called because it is based on the look of the original Media Player software that was bundled with Windows, but it&apos;s evolved far beyond its humble beginnings.</p><p>As the name implies, the focus here is on video, but it also handles music very well. With a massive range of built-in codecs, you&apos;ll be hard pressed to find a file it can&apos;t play.</p><p>Media Player Classic Home Cinema also works as a TV tuner provided you have a TV card installed, and you can adjust the appearance of your chosen movie or programme as it&apos;s playing.</p><p>If you&apos;re looking for software to manage your media collection, you&apos;re probably best looking elsewhere, but as a lightweight playback tool, Media Player Classic Home Cinema brilliant &#x2013; and highly customizable to boot.</p><p><strong>Download here: </strong><a href="https://mpc-hc.org/downloads/" target="_blank"><strong>Media Player Classic Home Cinema</strong></a></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>The cyber expert responsible for stopping the WannaCry malware attack on the NHS has been arrested in America.</description>
      <pubDate>Fri, 04 Aug 2017 11:53:35 +0000</pubDate>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The cyber expert who managed to successfully stop the WannaCry ransomware attack on the British National Health Service (NHS) has been arrested in America on charges of being involved in crimes relating to Kronos malware. Known as MalwareTech, 23 year old Marcus Hutchins from the UK, was in America for cyber defence conference Def Con.</p><p>The US department of justice has confirmed that Hutchins &#x201C;was arrested in the United States on 2 August, 2017, in Las Vegas, Nevada, after a grand jury in the Eastern District of Wisconsin returned a six-count indictment against Hutchins for his role in creating and distributing the Kronos banking Trojan.&#x201D;</p><p><a href="http://www.itproportal.com/2014/07/22/meet-kronos-the-new-banking-trojan-you-need-to-be-worrying-about/" target="_blank">Kronos</a> was a malware that harvested people&#x2019;s bank login details in order to steal money from their accounts. The malware was offered for purchase on cybercriminal forums in 2014 for the not-insignificant sum of $7,000 (&#xA3;4,100 by the time&#x2019;s conversion rates).&#xA0;</p><p><br></p>
<h3>The true meaning of Trojan</h3>
<p>Given Hutchins&#x2019;s involvement in the cyber security community, this arrest has come as a surprise &#x2013; particularly to his mother, who told the press association that she had been &#x201C;frantically calling America&#x201D; to try and contact Hutchins.&#xA0;</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/15/accidental-hero-who-halted-cyber-attack-is-22-year-old-english-blogger" target="_blank">The Guardian, </a>Hutchins was revealed to be working out of his family home when he managed to stop the WannaCry malware attack earlier in the year. At the time, there was something of an outcry in the cyber community that someone who was hailed as a hero was doxxed (a term used to refer to the disclosure of personal information about a user) by the mainstream media who were commending him.</p><p>Hutchins managed to stop the attack by registering the domain that the malware was trying to contact. On <a href="https://www.malwaretech.com/2017/05/how-to-accidentally-stop-a-global-cyber-attacks.html" target="_blank">his blog</a> where he details his actions during the attack, he posits that the URL was being used for the malware to establish whether it was being &#x2018;sandboxed&#x2019; (a technique whereby elements of a computer system are kept siloed from other sections for safety).</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/heroic-ransomware-blocker-charged-over-malware/" target="_blank">Digital Trends</a>: &#x201C;A court hearing is expected to take place on Friday aimed at organizing his legal representation.&#x201D; As we hear more about proceedings we will keep you updated.&#xA0;</p>

<p><strong>BT Unlimited Broadband | 12 months | Up to 17Mb | Weekend calls | BT Sports | &#xA3;9.99 upfront| &#xA3;24.99pm</strong><br>
Usually, standard ADSL broadband from BT comes out a little more expensive than from other providers. But now you get free BT Sport for a year, it&apos;s well worth considering again. Unless you also add a full TV package to your broadband (starting at &#xA3;50), you&apos;ll have to watch BT Sport online or via BT&apos;s app. You&apos;ll also get a &#xA3;40 Reward Card - a pre-paid Mastercard you can spend in store or online. <strong>Total cost of 12 months &#xA3;309.87</strong></p><p><strong>View this </strong><a href="https://www.productsandservices.bt.com/products/add-bt-sport-pack/" target="_blank"><strong>BT Unlimited Broadband plus BT Sport deal</strong></a></p>

BT Infinity <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/fibre-broadband-deals">superfast fibre broadband</a> gives speeds of up to 52Mb (6.5MB per second), which is about 50% faster than most other providers&apos; entry-level fibre speeds. You have to pay an extra tenner for the activation fee, but as well as 12 months of BT Sport you also get BT&apos;s TV Starter package (adding the usual Freeview channels), a YouView box and an &#xA3;80 Reward Card. That&apos;s a lot of freebies for your money. <strong>Total cost of 12 months &#xA3;429.87</strong></p><p><strong>View this </strong><a href="http://www.mobiles4everyone.com/linkbb.asp?siteid=future&amp;dealid=bt104&amp;postcode=&amp;subtag=trd-422257537" target="_blank"><strong>BT Infinity broadband plus BT Sport deal</strong></a></p>

<h3>What other sports does BT Sport show?</h3>
<p><a href="http://sport.bt.com/" target="_blank">BT Sport</a> continues to add more and more sports to its portfolio. If you can&apos;t get enough of the sound of leather on willow, then BT Sports has exclusive coverage of the England cricket team&apos;s sojourn to Australia for this winter&apos;s Ashes. It also has the rough and tumble double threat of Aviva Premiership rugby union and UFC ultimate fighting.</p>
<h3>What happens to BT Sport after a year?</h3>
<p>After you&apos;ve enjoyed/endured the highs and lows of the 2017-18 football season, BT will turn off the tap to its free BT Sport subscription. When your broadband plan hits its 13th month, you&apos;ll be on the hook to pay &#xA3;3.50 per month to carry on watching the channels if you go for superfast fibre Infinity or &#xA3;7pm if you get standard ADSL.</p>
<h3>I&apos;m already with BT broadband. Do I get free BT Sport?</h3>
<p>You can probably already guess this, but good on you for clutching at those straws. This deal is for new customers only we&apos;re afraid. If you want to add BT Sport to your broadband plan, you&apos;ll need to pay an extra &#xA3;3.50 a month for the sport channels.</p>
<h3>What is a BT Reward Card?</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.productsandservices.bt.com/products/bt-reward-card/#" target="_blank">Reward Card</a> that BT sends out is a pre-paid credit card that you can use anywhere that accepts Mastercard. In short, that&apos;s around a million shops, cafes and restaurants around the world, so you shouldn&apos;t find it difficult to find places to spend, spend, spend.</p><p>It&apos;s an old-fashioned chip and pin card, rather than contactless. But do make sure that you claim your Reward Card within three months of signing up to BT, otherwise you&apos;ll lose out on all that cash.</p>

<p><strong>VIVID 50 fibre broadband<br>
</strong>Thanks to its dazzling speeds and independent cabling, Virgin Media&apos;s broadband has traditionally been more expensive than its competitors. But the recently launched VIVID 50 tariff now brings the monthly price down under &#xA3;30 per month. Considering you&apos;ll be getting 50Mb speed (equivalent to 6.25MB per second), that&apos;s a very nice price.</p>

<p><strong>VIVID 100 fibre broadband</strong><br>
No longer the cheapest Virgin fibre deal on the block, you&apos;ll need to pay over &#xA3;30 to get Virgin&apos;s second lowest broadband tariff. But you&apos;re unlikely to feel too shortchanged with the connection speeds. The 100Mb claimed speed translates to 12.5 MB per second - you shouldn&apos;t be frustrated with any buffering, even when a few of you are streaming content at the same time.</p>

<p><strong>VIVID 200 fibre broadband</strong><br>
As Virgin proudly points out, VIVID 200 more than doubles the maximum speed supplied by BT Infinity and Sky Fibre&apos;s fastest speed. The ultrafast 200Mb speed is a good fit if you stream 4K films and if there are 10 or so devices connected at once. And like all of Virgin&apos;s broadband offerings, it&apos;s completely unlimited - you can download and stream as much as you wish.&#xA0;</p>

<p><strong>VIVID 200 Gamer</strong><br>
There&apos;s more than just the &apos;boss-level broadband&apos; tagline that should appeal to gamers about this fibre package. Pay an extra fiver from the standard VIVID 200 to bag up to 20Mb upload speeds - handy for online gaming. And you don&apos;t have to worry about online traffic management that can slow you down at peak times.</p>

<p><strong>VIVID 300 fibre broadband</strong><br>
Home broadband speeds in the UK don&apos;t come faster than those provided by Virgin&apos;s VIVID 300 fibre plan, and no other provider comes anywhere even close. It costs almost &#xA3;50 a month, but you get speeds of up to 37.5MB per second. That&apos;s extremely rapid.</p>

<h3>How much is a Virgin Media bundle with broadband and TV?</h3>
<p>To entice you in, Virgin has some broadband and TV bundles with an attractive price tag for the first year:</p><p><strong>Player bundle </strong>Virgin&apos;s basic bundle adds 70+ TV channels, weekend calls, Sky On Demand and a brand new 500GB TiVo box to the VIVID 100 broadband plan - and for the first 12 months it won&apos;t cost you a penny more. It rises significantly after the first year.</p><p><strong>Mix bundle</strong> The Mix bundle more than doubles the amount of channels you get with the Player bundle, adding the likes of Sky 1, Sky Sports News and &#xA0;Sky Living. Plus, you get upgraded to the <a href="http://www.techradar.com/reviews/virgin-tv-v6-box" target="_blank">Virgin TV V6 box</a>, which allows you to record up to six channels at once until you fill the 1TB storage.</p><p><strong>Fun bundle </strong>Around an extra tenner a month adds a bunch of children&apos;s channels to the Mix. As well as Nickelodeon channels and Cartoon Network, you get Discovery, too.</p><p><strong>Full House bundle</strong> If you&apos;re happy to part with more than &#xA3;50 a month for your broadband and TV, Virgin&apos;s Full House bundle combines the VIVID 200 fibre broadband package with more than 245 TV channels. There&apos;s good news for sports fans - the extra channels include BT Sport 1, 2 and 3. And there are included box sets if drama&apos;s more your thing.</p><p><strong>VIP bundle</strong> With the VIP bundle Virgin rolls out the red carpet. As well as premium TV channels such as all the Sky Sports and Sky Cinema offerings, Virgin also throws in a second Virgin TV V6 box. That means you can record up to 12 channels at once with 2TB of storage - enough for around 1,000 hours of TV. Ideal for large families.</p>

<h3>Can I get a phone line with Virgin Media broadband?</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.virginmedia.com/shop/broadband/compare.html" target="_blank">You can indeed</a> - and the good news is that you can keep the phone number you previously had with your BT phone line.</p><p>The starting cost is roughly the same as a Virgin broadband only plan for the first 12 months, and then goes up after the first year. That includes unlimited weekend calls to landlines and numbers on Virgin Mobile.</p><p>After that, you can start adding extra talk time to your plan. A little extra a month gets you Talk More Weekends, which adds all UK mobiles to your allowance. Talk More Evenings and Weekends allows calls to any UK number after 7pm on weekday evenings, while Talk More Anytime gives you as many calls as you like at any time of day.</p><p>Got friends or family abroad? A further upgrade allows calls to 30 international locations - including Australia, Canada and the USA - as part of the Talk More International Anytime plan.</p>

<h3>Do I have to pay anything up front for Virgin broadband?</h3>
<p>Yes, but not a lot. No matter which Virgin Media broadband package you choose, you&apos;ll have to pay a one-off &#xA3;20 activation fee.</p>
<p><img  id="iCwTVcjFaBFnAwTsQoqNJa" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iCwTVcjFaBFnAwTsQoqNJa.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen=""></p>

<h3>How long will my Virgin Media contract be?</h3>
<p>The standard Virgin broadband contract is for 12 months, after which your monthly price may be subject to change.</p><p>But if you&apos;re a commitment-phobe, you can choose to go on a flexible 30 day rolling contract instead. The only downside is that you have to pay &#xA3;65 upfront for the privilege.</p>

<h3>How do I contact the Virgin Media helpline?</h3>
<p>You can call 0345-4545-1111 to speak to one of Virgin&apos;s customer advisers, or 150 from a Virgin phone. But that&apos;s only between 8am and 10pm - outside of those times you&apos;ll have to rely on the company&apos;s online support pages.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>UPDATE: </strong></em><em>The wait is over. Wet Hot American Summer: 10 Years Reunion is finally available to stream on Netflix.&#xA0;They said they would meet 10 years later and they&apos;ve only gone and bloody done it. While the last Wet Hot American Summer show was a prequel to the movie, this is a sequel - showing what happened to the gang a decade after summer camp. It looks like they&apos;ve got most of the team back together, including Amy Poehler, Elizabeth Banks and Paul Rudd.</em></p>
<p>Welcome to the best shows on Netflix, TechRadar&apos;s constantly updated guide to the good, great and greatest television series that the streaming giant has to offer.&#xA0;</p><p>Netflix has come a long way in a few short years. Where once streaming was seen as the second cousin twice removed to broadcast television, it is now competing on the same level. You can see this in the shows Netflix is producing. It used to be that we only had HBO for high-quality drama, but the emergence of Netflix exclusives such as The Crown, Narcos and Stranger Things have garnered plaudits, awards and, most importantly, viewers.&#xA0;</p><p>While Netflix doesn&apos;t divulge the numbers for these shows, it has around 48 million US subscribers and 41 million subscribers overseas. That&apos;s a phenomenal amount of eyeballs on these shows.&#xA0;</p><p>There&#x2019;s a lot of things available on Netflix and not all of it is good, in fact some of it is terrible as our column <a href="http://www.techradar.com/tag/not-on-my-watch"><ins>Not On Our Watch</ins></a> proves - for every Breaking Bad, there&apos;s a Flaked.&#xA0;</p><p>It&apos;s lucky then that we have separated wheat from chaff, silt from gold and come up with a definitive list of 50 shows you really need to watch right now.&#xA0;</p><p>Whether you are into small-screen superheroes, government cover-ups or meth-making teachers with only months to live, there is something on this best shows on Netflix list for you.</p><p>It&apos;s fair to say there&#x2019;s never been a better time to bag yourself a Netflix subscription and binge watch.</p><p>Many of the shows available on the streaming platform are available in 4K and HDR. Where possible we highlight this in the list. And as for placement, this isn&#x2019;t a countdown - the shows on here are added in alphabetically.&#xA0;</p>

<p>Netflix shows no sign of slowing down when it comes to creating its own original content. The following shows will be out later in the year and all of them have had A Lot of money spent on them and big stars attached...</p>
<h3>Narcos: Season 3</h3>
<ul ><li>Out 1 September</li></ul>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ory6b2EJ3Bk"></iframe>
<p>We&apos;re not one to offer up spoilers so we&apos;ll just let the latest trailer speak for itself. But it&apos;s fair to say that it&apos;s all change for Narcos in season 3 - the fantastic Netflix drama that centres on the drug empires of the Seventies and Eighties and the agents whose job it is to track down the bad guys.&#xA0;</p>
<h3>Inhumans</h3>
<ul ><li>Out TBA</li></ul>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xU9Z6cKsbY0"></iframe>
<p>Comic-Con San Diego has thrown up a ton of new trailers for the comic-book crowd. One that&apos;s causing quite a stir is the new trailer for Inhumans, a new TV show for Netflix. The first trailer wasn&apos;t that well received, with the acting, costumes and effects all looking a little shonky, but the second trailer is a vast improvement. We&apos;re still not 100% convinced but maybe that&apos;s because there&apos;s been a glut of superhero stuff around at the moment.&#xA0;</p>
<h3>Stranger Things: Season 2</h3>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9Egf5U8xLo8"></iframe>
<ul ><li><strong>October 27</strong></li></ul>
<p>Stranger Things was a revelation when it first landed on Netflix. A love letter to the horror and sci-fi movies of the &apos;80s, the show played on nostalgia but also managed to be something original. The second series looks to expand on the mythos behind The Upside Down and promises bigger and scarier monsters.</p>
<h3>Star Trek Discovery</h3>
<ul ><li>25 September</li></ul>
<p><img  id="XtXgvNhQHLdRsdntiBcrFg" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XtXgvNhQHLdRsdntiBcrFg.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen=""></p>
<p>Star Trek Discovery has been a long time coming. Show-runner Bryan Fuller delayed the show as he was working on American Gods but now we finally have a &#xA0;release date. It will be shown in the UK on Netflix from 25 September, with a new episode to air weekly. Although the show is 15 episodes long only eight are being released initially with the rest coming in the new year. This is to help with pre-production, apparently. This was a trick The Get Down used - it&apos;s unknown how many actually came back to watch the second batch of episode of the now-cancelled show. Discovery stars The Walking Dead&apos;s Sonequa Martin-Green and is set 10 years before Kirk and his crew boldly went through space and beyond.</p>
<h3>The Dark Crystal</h3>
<ul ><li><strong>Out TBA</strong></li></ul>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OGzVYyV_Jsg"></iframe>
<p>We may soon have a new must-have watch in our best shows on Netflix guide! Do you remember Dark Crystal, the fantasy, puppet-filled adventure from the brilliant mind of Muppet creator Jim Henson? It&apos;s set to make a comeback as an all-new prequel TV series thanks to Netflix. It&apos;s vaguely slated to be &quot;coming soon&quot; to the service, but you can get a sneak peek in the trailer.</p>
<h3>The Punisher</h3>
<ul ><li><strong>Out November</strong></li></ul>
<p><img  id="ArkeUypGfbnPRkyePDeqKJ" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ArkeUypGfbnPRkyePDeqKJ.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen=""></p>
<p>The Punisher was meant to just play a bit part in Netflix&apos;s Marvel world.But &#xA0;Jon Bernthal&apos;s depiction of Frank Castle, the vigilante war veteran was so good in Daredevil: Season 2 he&apos;s been given his own show. The plot is still shrouded in mystery but don&apos;t expect this one to be a laugh-fest. The character of the Punisher is one of the most tortured around, so the atmosphere for this show is going to be dark, dark, dark.</p>
<h3>Jessica Jones: Season 2</h3>
<p><img  id="iSXVjDqw2HWW7gkfKntBwN" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iSXVjDqw2HWW7gkfKntBwN.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen=""></p>
<ul ><li><strong>Sometime in 2018</strong></li></ul>
<p>Krysten Ritter recently revealed that Jessica Jones: Season 2 will be more &apos;bingeable&apos; than season one. Quite what that means we don&apos;t know but it does point to a faster-paced than the first fun but stretched instalment. Alongside Ritter, Trish Walker (Rachael Taylor) is back and the action takes place after The Defenders show, which debuts in August.</p>
<h3>The Defenders</h3>
<ul ><li><strong>Out 18th August</strong></li></ul>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4h3m7B4v6Zc"></iframe>
<p>It&apos;s been a mixed bag for Netflix TV shows. It all started off so promisingly, however. Daredevil and Jessica Jones were superb dramas with the right amount of action, gravitas and fun. It slipped slightly with Daredevil Season 2 - it went way too dark, but did give us a great Punisher. Luke Cage was fantastic to start with and trailed off and Iron Fist was just a bit meh. The new Defenders trailer is superb though, bringing all of the characters together Avengers style - but this time with swears.&#xA0;</p><p>Oh, and another Marvel antihero - Punisher - is also <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/video/the-punisher-is-officially-coming-to-netflix-1320092"><ins>getting his very own</ins></a> - probably very gory - series.</p>
<h3>Mindhunter</h3>
<ul ><li><strong>Out October</strong></li></ul>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n2UBToW8P1M"></iframe>
<p>David Fincher is no stranger to Netflix, he&apos;s heavily involved in House of Cards as producer and directed the first episode, but Mindhunter is Fincher going full Fincher. It&apos;s based on John Douglas&apos; book of the same name and charts the life of an FBI profiler whose job it is to track serial killers.</p>
<h3>Dark</h3>
<ul ><li><strong>Out Winter 2017</strong></li></ul>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pc0LkPiB_cg"></iframe>
<p>If you are at a loss after watching Stranger Things, the Dark is for you. It&apos;s the &#xA0;first German-language series Netflix has made and the lot is about two missing children - but it&apos;s not just about that as there&apos;s supernatural elements and sci-fi twists galore.</p>
<p>The Jim Carey movie of the stories by Lemony Snicket was passable. But given there are 13 books on the exploits of Count Olaf and the Baudelaire children -Violet, Klaus, and Sunny - it made sense that Netflix would want to make a show out of it. Focusing on the first four books, the series nails the dour atmosphere of the books, with Patrick Wharburton popping up as Snicket to berate the viewer, much like the books. But it&apos;s because of Neil Patrick Harris&apos; evil Count Olaf that the show really shines. He&apos;s not as hammy as Carey but manages to be menacing while still having a blast.</p><p><strong>Seasons on Netflix: 1</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80114990?" target="_blank"><strong>Watch on Netflix now</strong></a></p>
<p>Pub quiz time: what does Downton Abbey and Archer have in common? Yup, that&apos;s right, ISIS. Both shows had to magically rid themselves of the ISIS name - Downton&apos;s dog was named ISIS, while Archer&apos;s secret spy organisation had the name as its acronym. In Archer, the show does great at referencing just why the name disappears but that&apos;s the beauty of Archer. It&apos;s a show that is all-knowing and hilarious with it. Now in its seventh season, Archer has slightly rejigged its animation and kept itself completely relevant, cementing itself as one of the best &apos;adult&apos; animations around.</p><p><strong>Seasons on Netflix: 8</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80046146?" target="_blank"><strong>Watch on Netflix now</strong></a></p>
<p>If it wasn&apos;t for Netflix, Arrested Development would have stayed as a three-season wonder. The streaming giant decided to take a gamble and fund a fourth season of Mitchell Hurwitz&apos;s brilliant family comedy and we are glad it did. While splitting the family up for most of the season meant some of the spark had disappeared - this was done to fit in with the actors&apos; busy schedules - the fourth season proved that there was still a lot to like about the dysfunctional Bluth family. Filled with season-long in-jokes, perfect site gags and spot-on wordplay, Arrested Development is a comedy that needs to be watched on repeat - and even then you will find something new to laugh at.</p><p><strong>Seasons on Netflix: 4</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/70133673?" target="_blank"><strong>Watch on Netflix now</strong></a></p>
<p>Written by the folks behind Peep Show - Sam Bain and Jesse Armstrong - and helped into the world by Danny Boyle, who directed the first feature-long episode, Babylon is a searing satire of the British constabulary. Seen through the eyes of US PR machine Liz Garvey - a fantastic Brit Marling - the show charts a variety of people in the police force, from the ones on the street to those in the executive suites. Brazen in its mix of comedy and drama, Babylon is that rare, intelligent TV series that doesn&apos;t shirk on showing the ineptitude that happens in a world governed by bureaucracy.</p><p><strong>Seasons on Netflix: 1</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80083983?" target="_blank"><strong>Watch on Netflix now</strong></a></p>
<p>Freddie Highmore was one of the sweetest child actors around in his younger years, playing cherubic children in the likes of Finding Neverland and the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.&#xA0;</p><p>Now he&apos;s a fully fledged adult he&apos;s taken a much darker turn as future Psycho psycho Norman Bates in the show Bate Motel. A prequel of sorts to the Psycho movies, Bates Motel is a fantastic spin on the horror tale, ramping up the relationship Bates has with his mother - a cold and calculating Vera Farmiga - and sprinkling breadcrumbs along the way that point to how he became who he became.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Seasons on Netflix: 4</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/70283134?" target="_blank"><strong>Watch on Netflix now</strong></a></p><p><br></p>
<p>As far as dystopian fiction goes, Black Mirror is up there with the very best. Penned by Charlie Brooker, who before this was disassembling and decimating the news in his show NewsWipe, Black Mirror is a handful of caustic tales about the perils of technology, shady governments and human nature as a whole.</p><p>Not only has Netflix nabbed the original seven episodes of the show to stream, comprising two series and a Christmas special, but it also funded a further six. The episode&apos;s themes are not too far from issues facing us all today: social media highs and embarrassing lows, technology going awry and new games that start to feel all-too real. Fantastic stuff. &#xA0;</p><p><strong>Seasons on Netflix: 3</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80104629?" target="_blank"><strong>Watch on Netflix now</strong></a></p>
<p>Any series that has Coach from Friday Night Lights in it will be watched by TechRadar - thankfully Bloodline has enough intrigue and plot development to make us keep watching, even when Kyle Chandler isn&apos;t on the screen. Yes it meanders but if you can forgive the slow pace this dark tale of a Florida family really delivers in its final episodes of the first series - and this filters through both the second and third and final series.</p>

<p>Vince Gilligan made no secret of the fact he wanted to re-visit the world of Breaking Bad and, while many were apprehensive that it was &apos;too soon&apos;, we shouldn&apos;t have been worried. Yes, there was always a fear that Better Call Saul would turn out to be what Joey was to Friends but it has thankfully more Frasier to Cheers. This all thanks to Bob Odenkirk&apos;s portrayal of Jimmy McGill, the lawyer who - despite the world he is in - has his heart is in the right place, even if he is consistently in the wrong place. The second season is just as masterful as the first, upping the tension between the Saul and his brother and more groundwork is laid for him becoming Saul Goodman. But that&apos;s the brilliance of this show - you come expecting Saul Goodman but what Gilligan has done is offered up a fantastically flawed character study of a man on the constantly on the brink of being good.</p><p>Season 3 brings Saul closer than ever to the Breaking Bad universe, with the introduction of Gus Fring!&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Seasons on Netflix: 3&#xA0;</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80021956?" target="_blank"><strong>Watch on Netflix now</strong></a></p>
<p>A comedy about a failed &apos;90s sitcom star doesn&apos;t sound like the most enticing premise for a cartoon. But when that failed star is a horse and is voiced by the brilliant Will Arnett, it turns out to be comedy gold. It takes a handful of episodes for the show to ease into itself, but once it does it doesn&apos;t let up with the cutting comedic cynicism centred around Hollywood and its, well, bleakness.</p><p>The second season manages to pack more laughs into each scene but also shines a light on more serious issues such as mental illness. Yup, this isn&apos;t your normal cartoon.</p><p>The third season has also landed, continuing the levels of absurdity and cementing the show as one of the best around.</p><p><strong>Seasons on Netflix: 3</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80048076?" target="_blank"><strong>Watch on Netflix now</strong></a></p>
<p>More addictive than the meth pushed by Walt and Jessie (apparently, ahem), Breaking Bad is brilliant binge-watching television. The initial plot is simple: a straight-laced teacher is told he has cancer and to make sure he leaves his family with the best possible life, he turns to drug making and dealing. There&apos;s method to his madness as he ends up being pretty good at it. Creator Vince Gilligan has created such a good group of characters, he is currently mining the same world again with Better Call Saul. But that has some way to go reach the highest highs that Breaking Bad offers.</p><p><strong>Seasons on Netflix: 5</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/70196252?" target="_blank"><strong>Watch on Netflix now</strong></a></p>
<p>Is The Crown Netflix&apos;s crowning glory? Not quite, but it is a sumptuous look at one of the world&apos;s most famous families: the Royal family. Charting the early years of the relationship between the Queen (Claire Foy) and Prince Philip &#xA0;(former Doctor Who Matt Smith), the show was written by Peter Morgan and, at &#xA3;100 million, is one of the most expensive TV series ever made.

<p>When it comes to superhero movies, Marvel are bossing DC thanks to the rich tapestry it has weaved with its cinematic universe. Its TV shows, as fun as Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D and Agent Carter are, haven&apos;t had the same success as DC&apos;s The Arrow or The Flash. Thankfully Daredevil has come along to change all this. Released in one binge-watching dose, Daredevil is superb television, regardless if you are a superhero fan or not. Matt Murdoch&apos;s (Boardwalk Empire&apos;s Charlie Cox) rise from blind lawyer to vigilante is brutal and steeped in realism. The reason it works so well is that it doesn&apos;t shy away from being violent - each crack and crunch is a world away from Ben Affleck&apos;s terrible movie version. And special mention has to go to Vincent D&apos;Onofrio as Wilson Fisk, his best role since the tortured Private Pyle.</p><p>Daredevil season two is out now and adds Elektra and Punisher into the mix. With new showrunners on board, the show has shifted slightly tonally but the brutality of the fight scenes are still there - you just need to check out Episode 3 to see what we mean.</p>

<p>Mackenzie Crook was one of the breakout stars from The Office, swapping his brilliant performance as the hapless Gareth for Hollywood roles in Pirates of the Caribbean and Game of Thrones. But it&apos;s on home soil where he fares best.</p><p>The Detectorists, written by and starring Mackenzie, is a warm, brilliant comedy. Based around the lives of a group of metal detectorists, it features brilliant writing, acting and characters - in any given episode, you will either be in tears of laughter or poignancy.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Seasons on Netflix: 2</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80075575?" target="_blank"><strong>Watch on Netflix now</strong></a></p>
<p>Following in the footsteps of fellow &apos;mumblecore&apos; members the Duplass brothers - whose brilliant Creep was a Netflix exclusive - Joe Swamberg has hit Netflix with a candid and considered look at sex and relationships.</p><p>Easy is an eight-episode look at relationships in Chicago. There&apos;s a different subject for each episode, although each life portrayed eventually overlaps in the show in some way.&#xA0;</p><p>Cast-wise, Easy has some surprisingly big names. Malin Akerman and Orlando Bloom star in one vignette, while the likes of Emily Ratajkowski, Marc Maron and Dave Franco also make an appearance.&#xA0;</p><p>Don&apos;t go into Easy expecting explosive drama or high-tense action, but as a realistic look at other people&apos;s love lives it&apos;s a great, if slightly meandering watch.</p><p><strong>Seasons on Netflix: 1</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80106603?" target="_blank"><strong>Watch on Netflix now</strong></a></p><p><br></p>
<p>There was a collective groan by Coen Brothers fans the world over when Fargo the television show was announced. But what could have been darn tootin&apos; awful ended up being fantastic, thanks to the casting of Billy Bob Thornton who is both funny and psychotic - well, his character is anyway. The series thankfully didn&apos;t retread the movie but added to it, acting as a strange but sublime companion piece. It&apos;s so good, the Coens initially refused to have their name on the show - until they saw it and loved it.</p><p>The second season is also now on Netflix and surpasses the first. The plotline veers away from the original film, but the heart of Fargo is still very much in this TV show. The second series flips back 27 years before the events of the original.</p><p><strong>Seasons on Netflix: 2</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/70303275?" target="_blank"><strong>Watch on Netflix now</strong></a></p>
<p>Unfairly cancelled after just one season, Freaks and Geeks was the starting point for many AAA comedy actors, directors and writers careers of today. Set around two factions of kids trying to get by in a typical US school: the freaks and, well, the geeks.&#xA0;</p><p>James Franco, Seth Rogan and Jason Segel are fantastic as part of the geek ensemble - Franco playing the heart throb, Rogan the monosyllabic beer fiend and Segel, the loveable stoner. While the geeks include Silicon Valley&apos;s Martin Starr and a superb John Francis Daley. But it&apos;s Lind Cardellini who&apos;s standout, playing Lindsay Weir, the math kid who decides to rebel.&#xA0;</p><p>Created by Paul Feig, who recently tried his hand at rebooting GhostBusters, and written by Judd Apatow, the show is great antidote to the whimsical teenage world of Dawson Creek and the like. &#xA0;</p><p><strong>Seasons on Netflix: 1</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/70253717?" target="_blank"><strong>Watch on Netflix now</strong></a></p><p>&#xA0;</p>
<p>The Get Down has a lot to live up to. It&apos;s the most expensive Netflix show ever made - knocking Marco Polo of that perch - thanks to its creator Baz Luhrmann&apos;s vibrant style that suits the show&apos;s premise. And that premise is a doozy: The Get Down charts the beginnings of hip-hop in the 1970s, telling the tale through the eyes of young rapper Ezekiel. Bombastic in its approach and beautiful to look at, The Get Down is a potent mix of fictional characters and real-life stars of the hip-hop scene, including Grandmaster Flash who also produced the show. All 12 episodes are available to binge now - you&apos;ll either love or hate it!</p><p>Netflix recently revealed that this will be the only season of The Get Down as it&apos;s cancelled the show - which we reckon is a big mistake as it&apos;s a great watch.</p><p><strong>Seasons on Netflix: 1 (part one and two)</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80025609?" target="_blank"><strong>Watch on Netflix now</strong></a></p>
<p>Alison Brie already proved she had comedic chops in Community but GLOW cements her as a comedy genius who can turn on the seriousness when she needs to. In GLOW (gorgeous ladies of wrestling) she plays Ruth Wilder, a struggling actress in &apos;80s LA who turns to women&apos;s wrestling to make a star of herself.&#xA0;The show is a look at the underground sensation of ladies wrestling, with all the wit and gender stereotype reversing you would expect from the maker of Orange Is The New Black. It&apos;s a great, highly original watch, with a superb cast that includes British singer Kate Nash.</p><p><strong>Seasons on Netflix: 1</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80115864?trackId=13462260&amp;tctx=0%2C0%2Ce1e24a37-4856-406a-af2a-345452eaa2b2-19192455" target="_blank"><strong>Watch on Netflix now</strong></a></p>
<p>Him &amp; Her is one of the best British sitcoms in years. Based around the lives of a bored, lazy but happy 20-something couple, the show&apos;s plot is slight but it manages to get laughs out of the most mundane happenings. Sarah Solemani is fantastic as Becky whose love for Steve (Russell Tovey) never falters, despite her parents disliking him. And Kerry Howard as Laura, Becky&apos;s sister, is the most hateful character since, well, ever.</p><p>All four series are now on Netflix and are an essential watch.</p><p><strong>Seasons on Netflix: 4</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/70298397?" target="_blank"><strong>Watch on Netflix now</strong></a></p>
<p>Homeland, now in its fifth season, is a very different show now than it was when it first aired back in 2011. Based on the Israeli series Prisoner of War, the first few seasons were based around the premise of a returning war hero that may or not be holding a dark secret. This duplicity has been a running theme since then but the narrative has moved on. What hasn&apos;t changed is the brilliant central performance by Claire Danes as the CIA officer with bi-polar disorder - she&apos;s superb and the glue that holds this sometimes disparate show together.</p><p><strong>Seasons on Netflix: 5</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/70241855?" target="_blank"><strong>Watch on Netflix now</strong></a></p>
<p>If there ever was a poster boy for Netflix, House of Cards would be it. Funded completely by the streaming service, Cards&apos; first season boasted direction by David Fincher and acting by Kevin Spacey and was addictive television. The reason: Netflix positively wanted you to binge watch, putting all episodes up at once. Now in its third season, Netflix&apos;s Card trick is still impressive and shows just how far Netflix has come, given it&apos;s shot in both 4K and HDR.</p><p><a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/television/house-of-cards-season-4-is-now-on-netflix-1316235">House of Cards Season 4</a> was more timely than ever before, with Frank Underwood fighting to get re-voted in as president which, on the face of it, was about as likely as Donald Trump rising to power. Oh...</p><p>And now we have the arrival of Season 5. This is the first without showrunner Beau Willimon. The good news is that is still feels like House of Cards and it also has a number of familiar faces returning.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Seasons on Netflix: 5</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/70248289?" target="_blank"><strong>Watch on Netflix now</strong></a></p>

<p>Initially made on a shoe-string budget, It&apos;s Always Sunny In Philadelphia first season had a cult following, but low viewing figures meant it was destined to be a one-series wonder. Thankfully, everything changed when Season 2 was eventually green-lit, thanks to some big-time star power. Danny De Vito joined for a 10-episode run that was extended because he loved it so much. He&apos;s still in the show that&apos;s now in its 11th season, bringing with him huge viewing figures. The antics of Dennis (Glenn Howerton), Mac (Rob McElhenney, the show&apos;s creator), Charlie (Charlie Kelly) and Sweet Dee (Kaitlin Olson) won&apos;t be for everyone - at its darkest the show&apos;s &apos;comedy&apos; themes range from nazism to drug abuse - but stick with it and this deliciously depraved classic will reward you.</p><p>A new, 12th season, has finally landed on Netflix, after airing in the US earlier this year. The show has also been renewed for two more seasons, which will make it the longest running live-action comedy series on TV ever. Impressive stuff.</p><p><strong>Seasons on Netflix: 12</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/70224484?" target="_blank"><strong>Watch on Netflix now</strong></a></p>
<p>And there was us thinking that Daredevil&apos;s subject matter was dark. Jessica Jones is another tale set in Hell&apos;s Kitchen that may be under the Marvel banned but is about as far removed from the bromance of Thor and Iron Man that you are likely to see.</p><p>Breaking Bad&apos;s Krysten Ritter is superb as the titular Jones, a private detective with superpowers and super issues. This is nocturnal noir that moves in the same circles as Daredevil - figuratively and literally as both characters will eventually team up in the Defenders. It may not have the bone-crunching violence that Daredevil is famed for, but there&apos;s enough booze, sex and black humour on the screen to make this a cracking comic-book caper that&apos;s strictly adults only.</p>

<p>Netflix struck true crime gold with How To Make a Murderer and its done the same again with The Keepers. This time the case in question is the murder of a nun in 1969 in Baltimore. The case remains unsolved and this documentary series goes back to the scene of the crime, speaking to witnesses and people who worked on the case.</p><p>This is a meticulously researched series, and one that has been in the works longer than Making a Murderer. It shows, too. Each episode ends on a new piece of evidence and by the end you&apos;ll be horrified with just how this case remained unsolved for so long. Gripping stuff.</p><p><strong>Seasons on Netflix: 1</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/browse?jbv=80122179&amp;jbp=11&amp;jbr=3" target="_blank"><strong>Watch on Netflix now</strong></a></p>
<p>This awkward rom-com has been penned by Judd Apatow and it&apos;s yet again another hit for Netflix Originals. It&apos;s a similar bedfellow to Master of None, but it improves on the themes of dating, love and city life with characters that are more rounded and a touch more awkward. Community&apos;s Gillian Jacobs is great as the prim Mickey, while Paul Rust is effortless as slacker Gus. The show stealer, though, is Apatow&apos;s uber talented daughter Iris who plays a frankly horrible child star.</p><p>The &apos;will they, won&apos;t they?&apos; shenanigans continue in the second season - those expecting a plot-heavy season will be disappointed, though, as Love meanders through its storylines - which is no bad thing if you ask us.</p><p><strong>Seasons on Netflix: 2</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80026507?" target="_blank"><strong>Watch on Netflix now</strong></a></p>
<p>Luke Cage is the latest addition to Netflix&apos;s impressive and growing Marvel TV show offering. Marvel has created a rich cinematic universe and although some of its TV shows (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D and Agent Carter) have struggled to stay on their feet others like Jessica Jones and Daredevil have flourished.</p><p>Luke Cage is more in the same vein as Jessica Jones and Daredevil, with less light-hearted superhero fun and more hard-hitting themes, violence, and grit.</p><p>After making his debut in the first series of Jessica Jones, Luke Cage is getting his own show which sees him swap Hell&apos;s Kitchen for Harlem, delving into his origins as a hero. Viewers who lamented the fact that they didn&apos;t get to see more of him in Jessica Jones will enjoy the opportunity to find out more about what makes his character tick here. Don&apos;t worry if you haven&apos;t watched Jessica Jones, it&apos;s not a requirement to understand or appreciate anything about Luke Cage.</p><p>The first season in its entirety is on Netflix now, making it perfect to settle in and binge watch.</p>

<p>Idris Elba was a relatively unknown actor when he blew us all away as Stringer Bell in The Wire. After starring in the show his career catapulted him into the A List, but he thankfully never forgot his TV roots. Luther is a cop show with a difference, and that difference is Elba. He brings that bit extra to a cop who is battling both deranged criminals and his own demons. He befriends murderers and breaks rules, all amongst the beautiful but broken backdrop of London&apos;s East End.</p><p><strong>Seasons on Netflix: 4&#xA0;</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/70174755?" target="_blank"><strong>Watch on Netflix now</strong></a></p>
<p>Five series of Mad Men have arrived on Netflix. While it may not be the full set - there were seven in all - there&apos;s enough here to bing watch and get caught up in Matthew Weiner&apos;s modern TV classic. On the face of it, Mad Men is about advertising execs - lead by the ever-conflicted Don Draper - in the Sixties but it&apos;s much much more. Each episode lingers, taking time to tell its tale, but it&apos;s worth the wait.

<p>Marco Polo may not have had the accolades that Netflix would have hoped for such an pricey series - at $90 million only Game of Thrones is more expensive - but it has enough going for it to keep you entertained. Benedict Wong is Kublai Khan, founder of the Yuan dynasty, while Lorenzo Richelmy plays Marco Polo, the Venetian whose travels to China see him given a place in the Khan&apos;s court.</p><p>Bombastic and old school, Marco Polo is a stunning watch - it&apos;s also HDR-ready so make sure you have a TV that can handle this type of content.</p><p>It was announced recently that Marco Polo will not be getting a third season, making it the first Netflix-owned series to be cancelled.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Seasons on Netflix: 2</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/70305606?" target="_blank"><strong>Watch on Netflix now</strong></a></p>
<p>Aziz Ansari was part of one of the best comedy ensembles ever in Parks and Recreation, but in Master of None he proves he can hold his own when he goes it alone. Channeling Louie CK, by way of Curb Your Enthusiasm, Master of None is a fantastic look at being in your 30s in Hollywood and all the trappings that go with it. Ansari plays the fictional Dev but this sitcom comes off as deeply personal and is all the better for it.</p><p>The second season improves on what is a fantastic first season. Dev is now in Italy, making pasta and trying to forget about acting. It&apos;s not long before he heads back to New York, though.</p>

<p>The world&apos;s fascination with real crime seems to be at its highest at the moment and it&apos;s all thanks to the podcast Serial. Now on to its second series, Serial highlights cases of crime in forensic detail. Making a Murderer is in a similar vein. This 10-part series looks at Steven Avery, someone who spent 18 years in prison for a crime he didn&apos;t commit and is then accused of a different crime. The show has been ten years in the making and is gripping stuff.</p><p><strong>Seasons on Netflix: 1</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80000771?" target="_blank"><strong>Watch on Netflix now</strong></a></p>
<p>Narcos is that wonderful thing: a TV show that doesn&apos;t scrimp on controversy. Based on the exploits of Columbian drug lord Pablo Escobar, the show examines the criminal&apos;s rise to the top of one of the biggest drug rings the world has seen, while constantly trying to avoid the clutches of the DEA.</p><p>Uncompromising, uncomfortable but completely unforgettable, Narcos is exactly the sort of thing that Netflix should be commissioning. It&apos;s also the sort of thing that HBO would have snapped up just a few years ago - which is very telling as to where television is today.</p><p><strong>Seasons on Netflix: 2</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80101273?" target="_blank"><strong>Watch on Netflix now</strong></a></p>
<p>The OA rounds off what has been an exceptional year for television on Netflix. Co-created by and starring the ever-brilliant Brit Marling, the show consists of eight episodes that rival Stranger Things for, well, strangeness.&#xA0;</p><p>Marling is a blind woman who comes back after disappearing for many years. Her sight is restored and she has a tale to tell. Although there are eight episodes they vary wildly in length - from 70 minutes to 30 minutes.

<p>Orange Is The New Black consistently tries to oust House of Cards from the Netflix top spot, with its superb tale of life in a women&apos;s prison. It&apos;s so popular that its makers have announced that the show will be running until at least season seven.</p><p>The show has finally returned for a fourth season and things of gotten very dark! Racial tensions and issues with the US prison system are the main plot points for season four and while the comedy is still there, it&apos;s slathered with a fair bit of drama.</p><p><strong>Seasons on Netflix: 5</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/70259443?" target="_blank"><strong>Watch on Netflix now</strong></a></p>
<p>Fresh from giving horror anthologies a new spin with American Horror Story, creator Ryan Murphy has taken this idea and expanded it into the world of crime. The first series of American Crime Story focuses on the very public case of OJ Simpson and the death of his wife Nicole. It&apos;s superb TV, dramatising what was one of the most engrossing true stories to come out of the &apos;90s. Cuba Gooding Jr is great as OJ but it&apos;s the supporting cast that steals the show. Sarah Paulson, David Schwimmer, John Travolta and Courtney B Vance ham it up to the max and it makes for some of the most entertaining television in years. &#xA0;</p><p><strong>Seasons on Netflix: 1</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80127673?" target="_blank"><strong>Watch on Netflix now</strong></a></p>
<p>Netflix&apos;s latest TV drama has been tipped as the next Breaking Bad, but it doesn&apos;t quite deserve that accolade. One of the main reason is that Jason Bateman&apos;s Marty Byrde has already broke bad, helping a Mexican cartel to fudge their figures. This means the descent that was so brilliant in Walter White isn&apos;t really seen here. But that doesn&apos;t mean that show isn&apos;t worth a stream - it&apos;s a tense, occasionally terrifying watch that mashes stereotypes and cultures as the Byrde family leave their home in Chicago for the Ozarks in Missouri.&#xA0;</p><p>Also, Jason Bateman is always worth a watch, even when he isn&apos;t winking at the camera Arrested Development style. But the real scene stealer is the ever-brilliant Laura Linney. She acts, directs and produces in this series, proving she&apos;s the real star of the show.</p><p><strong>Seasons on Netflix: 1</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80117552" target="_blank"><ins><strong>Watch on Netflix now</strong></ins></a></p>
<p>All nine seasons of Peep Show are now on Netflix - and if you haven&apos;t seen the show, then you are in for a treat. Charting the rather mundane lives of two flatmates Jez (Robert Webb) and Mark (David Mitchell), the show is a wry look at adults trying and failing to be adults.&#xA0;</p><p>All shot in first person - hence the name - Peep Show doesn&apos;t shirk from sex, drugs and political incorrectness but it does it all in such a brilliantly British way, that you don&apos;t mind at all when you are watching some of the most awkward TV moments, including one of the characters serving up a dead dog for dinner.&#xA0;</p><p>Don&apos;t ask, just watch.</p><p><strong>Seasons on Netflix: 9</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/70216232?" target="_blank"><strong>Watch on Netflix now</strong></a></p>
<p>From the mind of Jonathan Nolan - Inception writer and brother to Christopher - this twist-ridden series is as high concept as it gets. A computer algorithm offers up &apos;people of interest&apos; to a crack crime-fighting team which consists of former Jesus Jim Caviezel and Michael Emerson, last seen chewing the scenery as Lost&apos;s big bad Benjamin Linus. While the first season is a little by the numbers, this show has blossomed into something of a must watch.</p><p><strong>Seasons on Netflix: 4</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/70296223?" target="_blank"><strong>Watch on Netflix now</strong></a></p>
<p>As its third season nears, it&apos;s a perfect time to get into Rick and Morty. The show on its most linear level focuses on the relationship between a grandfather and his grandson. But it&apos;s oh so much more. It&apos;s a meditation on sci-fi tropes, a pop culture cauldron, a high-concept cartoon that&apos;s endlessly quotable and also a show that contains more than its fair share of fart jokes. It&apos;s endlessly bingeable and very funny - all thanks to its creator, Community&apos;s Dan Harmon.</p><p><strong>Seasons on Netflix: 3 (new episodes streaming every Tuesday)</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80098738?" target="_blank"><strong>Watch on Netflix now</strong></a></p>
<p>Slathered with a fantastic dose of black comedy, Santa Clarita Diet stars Drew Barrymore are the stereotypical TV mum, with one difference: she likes eating people. This brand-new show on Netflix is a great send up of the family sitcom, taking all the tropes that make Modern Family and the like so successful, then turning them on their head, and then eating their head. And be warned: when things are eaten it&apos;s all very grizzly. Timothy Olyphant also stars as the dad who is happy for his wife to be a flesh eater.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Seasons on Netflix: 1</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80119344?" target="_blank"><strong>Watch on Netflix now</strong></a></p>
<p>The Wachowski siblings have been more miss than hit lately - Cloud Atlas was brave but flawed, Jupiter Ascending was just flawed - but Sense8 sees something of a return to form for the directing duo.</p><p>Yes there are problems with Sense8 but this uneven show is brilliantly high concept and packed with interesting characters. Well, eight characters in all, from different parts of the globe that are connected in a variety of ways.</p><p>The disparate batch of characters means this is a show that has a lot in keeping with Cloud Atlas, where different genres nestled uneasily against each other. But it&apos;s a brave show and one that suits the lavish cinematography the Wachowskis are famed for.</p><p>A Sense8 Christmas special helped fill the gap before the second season - but now the second season is here and proves that the show is developing into something great. Unfortunately, the second season will be the last as Netflix has decided to pull the plug on the show.</p><p><strong>Seasons on Netflix: 2 (plus a feature-length Christmas special)</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80025746?" target="_blank"><strong>Watch on Netflix now</strong></a></p>
<p>Sherlock is a show that has been drip-fed to it audience over a number of years. This is partly due to its stories working better as three-episode arcs but also because its main stars, Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman have become bonafide superstars during its run, so pinning them down is somewhat difficult.</p><p>Cumberbatch is superb has the modern day Sherlock, but the show works because of a potent mix of scriptwriting (thanks to Doctor Who&apos;s Stephen Moffat), deft direction and a fair bit of challenging the viewer.

<p>There&apos;s very good reason Sons of Anarchy is the highest rated show on FX ever - its Shakespeare-esque plot (think Hamlet on bikes), following the tumultuous lives of a motorcycle gang, has everyone who watches it gripped.

<p>Now celebrating its 50th year, Star Trek is a movie and TV phenomenon that has no signs of slowing down. The original series, The Next Generation, Voyager and Deep Space Nine have all landed on Netflix but it is the first two series that are the best.</p><p>Watching it now, the original Star Trek maybe full of creaky sets and suspect acting but the show was bold, colourful and slathered in &apos;60s sci-fi innovation. The first series is superb, with perhaps the greatest-ever TV double act: William Shatner&apos;s Kirk and Leonard Nimoy&apos;s Spock. Kirk is all bluster and pomp, Spock is cool, calm and authoritative.</p><p>Unlike the original series, the Next Generation took a few seasons to get things right but it still fantastic viewing. Patrick Stewart is effortless as Captain Jean-Luc Picard and the rest of the crew are - including Data, William T Riker and Geordi La Forge - up there in stature with the original crew.</p><p><strong>Seasons on Netflix: 3 (Original Series); 7 (The Next Generation)</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/70178514?" target="_blank"><strong>Watch on Netflix now</strong></a></p>
<p>When it comes to TV and movies, the &apos;80s is the nostalgia decade of the moment. Whether it&apos;s Jeff Nichols&apos; Midnight Special that plays like a Steven Spielberg film, if Spielberg still made films like he did in the Eighties, or The Goldbergs and Red Oaks mining the decade for laughs, filmmakers can&apos;t get enough of the shell suits and Sony Walkmans.</p><p>Stranger Things is another brilliant homage to this era. Leaning heavily on Spielberg, John Carpenter and Stephen King - so much King - the story revolves around a small town, a group of friends, a missing person and a dodgy science lab. Writing anything else would give away the myriad twists in a show that is full of brilliant creepy fun.</p><p>The second season of Stranger Things had a new trailer debut at ComicCon and it looks epic.</p>

<p>The Thick Of It is perfect satire. It is the closest we will ever get to the machinations of politics, until they decide to let cameras roll 24/7 at Number 10. From the ever-sweary Malcolm Tucker to the string of forever-wrong MPs he has to protect with his profanities, The Thick Of It manages to show the world what an omnishambles a government in charge can be, with hilarious consequences.</p><p><strong>Seasons on Netflix: 4</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/70217124?" target="_blank"><strong>Watch on Netflix now</strong></a></p>
<p>The Trip is the perfect gig for Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon and one that must have been too good to pass on. Based on the flimsy premise that hyper realised versions of the two comedians drive around rural England eating in the best restaurants as food critics, the show shouldn&apos;t work but it really really does. Completely unscripted, each episode is strewn with movie star impressions and passive-aggressive jokes, where the two try to one-up each other. Director Michael Winterbottom manages to hold the show together with clever editing and cinematography and manages to add subtle plot through phone conversations with Steve and Rob and their respective families.</p><p>The second season has also landed on Netflix and it feels like a sumptuous main course. Italy is the setting and its beautiful surroundings seems to have made the pair more relaxed about life, while still bringing the funny.</p><p><strong>Seasons on Netflix: 2</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/70236575?" target="_blank"><strong>Watch on Netflix now</strong></a><strong><br>
</strong></p>
<p>Someone escaping from a Domesday cult shouldn&apos;t be a recipe for comedy but Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt manages to squeeze the funny out of this premise. Created by Tina Fey and starring Ellie Kemper as the title character, the show sparkles with wit and is the right side of kooky - unlike some other shows *cough* New Girl *cough* we won&apos;t mention.</p><p>Season Two of Kimmy Schmidt has arrived and is fizzing with the same energy of Season One and there&apos;s not long to wait for Season Three - it&apos;s out 19 May.</p><p><strong>Seasons on Netflix: 2</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80028212?" target="_blank"><strong>Watch on Netflix now</strong></a></p>
<p>The prequel to a film sequel that no one watched, Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp is both fantastic and utterly stupid. It has a cast list to die for - most of Mad Men are in there as is Ant Man&apos;s Paul Rudd and Bradley Cooper - and focuses on the goings on at the first day at camp.</p><p>These goings on include X-Files style conspiracies, homoerotic dancing, long lost rock singers, journalists going undercover and government hit men. In the original film the cast were in their 30s and were playing 17 year olds. In the prequel, the same cast is now in their 40s and are playing their characters&apos; younger selves. If you can get your head around that, then you are going to love the show.</p><p>Its TV sequel Wet Hot American Summer: 10 Years Later has also arrived and follows the gang 10 years after they left school.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Seasons on Netflix: 2 (First Day Of Camp / 10 Years Later)</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80117710?trackId=13752289" target="_blank"><strong>Watch on Netflix now</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80039664?" target="_blank"><strong>Watch on Netflix now</strong></a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p><strong>Sky Broadband Unlimited | 12 months | Up to 17Mb | Line rental inc. | No TV | &#xA3;19.95 upfront | &#xA3;18.99pm</strong><br>
BT-owned Plusnet had been leading the way for a while when it comes to the lowest broadband pricing - it was <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/plusnet-launches-uks-cheapest-fibre-broadband-deal">&#xA3;17.99 a month back in May</a>. But that&apos;s now come to an end, leaving Sky to take the title. This tariff is the very cheapest way that you can get home broadband - and now you even get a &#xA3;50 pre-paid Mastercard with it as well! <strong>Total cost over 12 months is &#xA3;247.83</strong></p><p><strong>View this deal at </strong><a href="http://www.mobiles4everyone.com/linkbb.asp?siteid=future&amp;dealid=skyx601&amp;postcode=&amp;subtag=trd-300254729" target="_blank">Sky broadband</a></p>

<h3>What broadband speed do I need?</h3>
<figure class=pull-left><p><img  id="scTHSLogpgXKpjjXMpBw4L" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/scTHSLogpgXKpjjXMpBw4L.jpg" align="left" fullscreen="" class="pull-left"></p></figure>
<p>If you simply want broadband for the cheapest price possible, you&apos;ll need to go for a standard ADSL connection. When you compare the prices of the cheapest standard speeds and unlimited superfast fibre, you&apos;ll see that you can save more than a fiver a month.</p><p>But if you&apos;re in the habit of streaming TV and films from the internet, or have lots of people in your household all online at once, then it pays to upgrade to fibre optic to allay annoying lags and slow webpage loading times. Broadband speeds are represented in megabits per second, or Mb - the greater the Mb, the faster the broadband speed (although your actual day-to-day speed will vary depending where you live).</p><p><strong>0-25Mb</strong> It&apos;s not an acronym you see so much these days, but ADSL broadband is now the entry-level connection you can get for your home. With speeds up to 17Mb - just over 2MB per second - it&apos;s perfectly fine for small households who want to surf the web, handle their emails and stream non-4k catch-up TV.</p><p><strong>25-50Mb </strong>Fibre broadband speeds start at up to 38Mb, so more than double what you get with standard ADSL. It&apos;s the sweet spot between fast speeds and good value and just the ticket for a family household where four or five members are all streaming, downloading and surfing at once.</p><p><strong>50+Mb </strong>If you want to stream uninterrupted 4K Ultra HD content from Netflix or Amazon Instant Video, then it&apos;s well worth going for superfast internet. The same goes if you know that loads of people will be using your router simultaneously. <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/bt-broadband-deals" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">BT Infinity deals</a>, for example, start at up to 52Mb. While only <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/virgin-broadband-deals">Virgin Media broadband</a> can offer 100Mb and over - that&apos;s an incredible 12.5MB per second.</p>

<h3>Fibre broadband checker - can I get fibre broadband?</h3>
<p>If you&apos;ve read our advice above but are wondering whether fibre broadband is actually available in your area (it can currently be accessed by around 90% of UK households), then wonder no longer! Head to the top of this page, bash in your postcode and if you see <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/fibre-broadband-deals">fibre broadband deals</a> on the list, then you&apos;re all good.</p>
<p><img  id="LjLSChGcLAPXe7bWyy6TkX" name="" caption="" alt="best broadband deals" src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6055d9b3b185c0b87d5043eec55f7653.jpg" link="" align="" fullscreen=""></p>

<h3>What contract length should I go for?</h3>
<p>Broadband providers can deal in 12, 18 or 24-month contracts, with some providers giving you the choice. If you&apos;ve got commitment issues or aren&apos;t sure how long you&apos;ll be at your property, then it&apos;s worth bagging one year deal. While getting an 18 month or two year deal often means that your price is guaranteed for longer.</p><p>If you need even greater flexibility, some companies offer 30 day contracts as well. Take Virgin for example. But bear in mind that they tend to charge higher set-up fees for the privilege.</p>
<p><img  id="LjLSChGcLAPXe7bWyy6TkX" name="" caption="" alt="best broadband deals" src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6055d9b3b185c0b87d5043eec55f7653.jpg" link="" align="" fullscreen=""></p>

<h3>Will I have to pay anything upfront for broadband?</h3>
<p>There are only a few exceptions to the rule that you&apos;ll have to pay at least a little something immediately when you sign-up for broadband. The best case scenario is that it&apos;s just to cover the cost of delivering the router, but some providers also charge a set-up or activation fee to get you connected.</p><p>But if you head to our comparison charge above and use the filter on the left, you&apos;ll see that some providers don&apos;t charge a penny up front. This varies from time-to-time, with companies such as BT, TalkTalk and Plusnet running limited-time promotions where they remove these fees completely. So fingers crossed...</p>

<h3>Can I get a phone line and TV channels with my broadband?</h3>
<p>If you&apos;re curious how much a combined broadband, phone and TV package might cost, you can use our filters in the comparison chart above to tailor the best broadband plan for you and your household. There are hundreds of combinations, allowing you to cherry pick the amount and type of TV channels you get or when you can make calls. So our table will take the pain out of choosing.</p>

<h3>Sky broadband only deals and speeds</h3>
<p><strong>Sky Broadband Unlimited | Up to 17Mb</strong><br>

Opting for Sky Fibre is the cheapest way to get superfast broadband at 38Mb. But beware - if you go for its cheapest deal, you&apos;ll be limited to using, downloading and streaming up to 25GB of data per month. Pay more for Sky Fibre Unlimited, or extra still for Sky Fibre Max giving you up to 76Mb speed (around 9.5MB per second) and a Sky Q Hub router.</p><p><a href="http://www.sky.com/shop/broadband-talk/broadband-compare/" target="_blank"><strong>View and compare Sky Broadband only deals</strong></a></p>

<h3>Plusnet broadband deals and speeds</h3>
<p><strong>Plusnet Unlimited | Up to 17Mb</strong><br>

Already one of the &apos;Big Six&apos; energy companies, SSE is offering cheap prices on broadband - which makes a change from its day job as one of the big six energy firms. There are special offers to be had if you use SSE as your energy supplier.</p><p><strong>SSE Superfast Fibre Broadband | Up to 38Mb</strong><br>
You&apos;ll have to go elsewhere if you need the very fastest broadband speeds, as SSE doesn&apos;t have a 72Mb option.

John Lewis has two superfast fibre plans to choose from, and both give you unlimited use and free set-up.

Yep, you guessed it - 38Mb and 76Mb fibre optic broadband are the two options available from the post office, with the latter called Unlimited Fibre Broadband Plus. Unlike its ADSL prices though, superfast broadband from the Post Office is on the dear side.</p><p><a href="http://www.postoffice.co.uk/broadband-phone" target="_blank"><strong>View and compare Post Office Broadband deals</strong></a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<h3>BT broadband packages compared - which is the best for me?</h3>
<p>All BT <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/broadband-deals">broadband deals</a> now feature unlimited data allowances. So the main choice you&apos;ll face with BT is what speed to go for. Standard ADSL broadband gives speeds of up to 17Mb which will probably give you a max download speed of around 2MB per second. Upgrade to BT Infinity - <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/fibre-broadband-deals">the company&apos;s fibre optic offering</a> - and you can choose between 52Mb and a super fast 76Mb.</p><p>After that, you can pay more to add home phone options and a TV subscription - although you may find some package bargains around <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/black-friday-2017" target="_blank">Black Friday</a> time. The latter includes a YouView box and access to the BT TV package of your choice - more on which below.</p>

<figure class=pull-left><p><img  id="5tY44prkEapnxsHg6YQDtd" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5tY44prkEapnxsHg6YQDtd.jpg" align="left" fullscreen="" class="pull-left"></p></figure>
<p><strong>BT Unlimited Broadband</strong><br>
BT&apos;s most affordable broadband offer gives up to 17Mb speed - that&apos;s just over 2MB per second. That should still be plenty fast enough to let you browse the web, stream music and watch interruption-free catch-up TV. But it may struggle to cope with larger households all using the internet at once. BT Unlimited Broadband includes:</p>
<ul ><li>Up to 17Mb speed</li><li>BT Home Hub 4 router</li><li>100GB of BT cloud storage</li><li>BT Virus Protect for two devices</li></ul>
<p><img  id="XpjytZKadYHuY5Kqsnopd7" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XpjytZKadYHuY5Kqsnopd7.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen=""></p>
<figure class=pull-left><p><img  id="L7AyazkNF85RhoTvZyx9cV" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/L7AyazkNF85RhoTvZyx9cV.jpg" align="left" fullscreen="" class="pull-left"></p></figure>
<p><strong>BT Unlimited Infinity 1</strong><br>
If fibre broadband is available where you live and you have a few extra pounds to spare a month, we&apos;d recommend cranking up the speed to BT&apos;s least expensive Infinity deal. At 52Mb (roughly 6.5MB/s), it&apos;s got the legs to seamlessly deliver HD video and fast downloads, even when there are a few of you using it. BT Unlimited Infinity 1 includes:</p>
<ul ><li>Up to 52Mb speed</li><li>BT Smart Hub</li><li>100GB of BT cloud storage</li><li>BT Virus Protect for two devices</li></ul>
<p><strong>BT Unlimited Infinity 2</strong><br>
If you demand extremely fast downloads and stream 4K films and TV, then BT&apos;s fastest broadband (76Mb) is well worth considering - especially if you&apos;ve got a bustling household all trying to log in at once. It&apos;s pricey, but BT sweetens the deal with some added extras. BT Unlimited Infinity 2 includes:</p>
<ul ><li>Up to 76Mb speed</li><li>BT Smart Hub</li><li>500GB of BT cloud storage</li><li>BT Virus Protect for 15 devices</li></ul>

<h3>What BT router will I get?</h3>
<p>BT throws in a router for free (although you&apos;ll have to pay for the delivery). The quality of router you receive will depend on the package you choose.&#xA0;</p>
<figure class=pull-left><p><img  id="B2oGNDfZcxnG3wW66nYuwW" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/B2oGNDfZcxnG3wW66nYuwW.jpg" align="left" fullscreen="" class="pull-left"></p></figure>
<p><strong>BT Home Hub </strong>Go for standard BT Unlimited Broadband and you&apos;ll get the basic Home Hub 4. You&apos;ve probably seen it sneakily peering at you from around corners in the homes of umpteen friends and families, although its dimensions are sleek enough that you should be able to stow it somewhere subtle without too much trouble. As well as wi-fi, you can also connect to it via an ethernet cable. It&apos;s perfectly functional, but doesn&apos;t have the same strength as the...</p>
<figure class=pull-left><p><img  id="QNSChctX44Eq9rfHpYZczZ" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QNSChctX44Eq9rfHpYZczZ.jpg" align="left" fullscreen="" class="pull-left"></p></figure>
<p><strong>BT Smart Hub </strong>Pay &#xA3;65 extra or upgrade to BT Infinity and you&apos;ll receive the more powerful Smart Hub. BT claims that it gives out the UK&apos;s most powerful wi-fi signal among the routers sent out by other major providers. Handy if you live in a big house or like to use your phone or laptop out in the garden.</p><p>Alternatively, you can stick with your existing router. But unless you&apos;ve shelled out a lot for your current model, you&apos;re probably better off swallowing the delivery charge and using the BT Home Hub or Smart Hub. That way, if anything goes wrong, you&apos;ll be able to use their tech support.</p>

<h3>How long will the contract be?</h3>
<p>Take BT broadband, and you&apos;ll be tied into a 12 month contract. After that, your monthly cost will go up by around a tenner. To encourage you to hang around, you can&apos;t use your BT router with any other broadband provider so you&apos;ll need to pay for a new one when you move on.</p>
<p><img  id="XpjytZKadYHuY5Kqsnopd7" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XpjytZKadYHuY5Kqsnopd7.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen=""></p>

<h3>Are there any BT broadband AND TV deals?</h3>
<p>There are three TV packages that you can add to your BT internet package, but you&apos;ll need to sign up for 12 months:</p><p><strong>Starter </strong>BT is chucking in its Starter TV package if you get Infinity - which includes 80 channels, together with BT&apos;s entry-level YouView box. It costs extra if you go for standard broadband.</p><p><strong>Entertainment Plus </strong>You can splash out an extra few quid a month for BT&apos;s Entertainment Plus package. This includes 110 channels and a YouView+ box to record up to 300 hours.</p><p><strong>Total Entertainment</strong> If you&apos;re totally addicted to films and box sets, then it may be worth spending &#xA3;15-ish a month on Total Entertainment. This is a must if you have a 4K TV, as BT throws in its YouView+ Ultra HD box. It can record 600 hours of video to help you keep abreast of the 141 channels it gives you access to.</p>

<figure class=pull-left><p><img  id="ZApYpJYn7UHAvRgsQAPFPB" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZApYpJYn7UHAvRgsQAPFPB.png" align="left" fullscreen="" class="pull-left"></p></figure>
<h3>What about BT Sport?</h3>
<p>Until recently, BT Sport came free with every BT internet plan. That&apos;s come to an end now...you&apos;ll have to pay an extra &#xA3;3.50 a month to get access to Premier League football, Ashes cricket, top-flight rugby union and exclusive UFC action. Keep your eyes peeled however, as Bt does run the occasional promotion where you can still get BT Sport for free.</p>
<p><img  id="XpjytZKadYHuY5Kqsnopd7" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XpjytZKadYHuY5Kqsnopd7.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen=""></p>

<h3>Can I make calls from a landline?</h3>
<p>You can indeed. No matter which BT broadband package you opt for, you get a landline phone number with unlimited weekend calls to other UK landlines. If you prefer nattering in the evening you can pay extra for unlimited landline calls between 7pm and 7am. While more still lets you make as many landline calls as you want at any time of the day. You&apos;ll be covered by free BT Call Protect as well, which will help to halt nuisance calls.</p>

<h3>Can I add BT Mobile?</h3>
<p>To goad you into bringing all your devices over to BT, it&apos;s offering &#xA3;5 a month off your monthly mobile phone tariff. BT Mobile has deals on all the biggest and newest handsets, including iPhones and Samsung Galaxys. In particular, that makes BT pretty competitive when it comes to <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/sim-only-deals-1297535">SIM only deals</a>.</p>

<h3>What is BT cloud storage?</h3>
<p>If you find yourself running out of storage space on your phone, tablet or laptop or want to back up your files, BT has its own cloud storage solution. With BT Unlimited Broadband and Infinity 1, you&apos;ll get 100GB - that&apos;s enough room for around 25,000 songs, 140 films or 100,000 photos. It&apos;s 500GB if you go for Infinity 2, which should be sufficient to store the music and photo collections of you and your family.</p>

<h3>What is BT Virus Protect?</h3>
<p>All BT broadband packages include BT&apos;s internet security tool, BT Virus Protect. As well as promising to vanquish viruses, it features BT Web Protect to flag phishing scams, BT Parental Controls to help you limit the websites your children can see and True Key for easy management of your passwords. As well as your main computer, you can apply BT Virus Protect to one other laptop, phone or tablet if you go for Broadband Unlimited or Infinity 1. While Infinity 2 lets you protect up to 15 devices. We still think you should get dedicated internet security however - check out our pick of the <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/the-best-antivirus-software-of-2017" target="_blank">best antivirus software</a>.</p>

<h3>What&apos;s a BT wi-fi hotspot?</h3>
<p>BT has dotted five million wi-fi hotspots around the UK and 18 million around the globe. As a BT Broadband customer, you&apos;ll have access to every one of them. So if you&apos;re on your laptop in a cafe or checking maps on your phone and see that BT Wi-fi is available, you can jump on for free.</p>
<p><img  id="XpjytZKadYHuY5Kqsnopd7" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XpjytZKadYHuY5Kqsnopd7.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen=""></p>
<figure class=pull-left><p><img  id="FGTXZLGZ3VQXNzS9CNGztU" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FGTXZLGZ3VQXNzS9CNGztU.jpg" align="left" fullscreen="" class="pull-left"></p></figure>
<h3>Are there any other perks to getting BT broadband?</h3>
<p>As well as the discounted mobile tariffs and cut price BT Sport, BT is luring in new customers with a BT Reward Card. This online exclusive means you can claim a prepaid Mastercard cash card if you sign up to BT Broadband.</p><p>The sum on the Reward Card changes regularly, but is usually in excess of &#xA3;50 -<br>
and sometimes as much as &#xA3;150. The amount on the card is always more with one of the BT Infinity packages.</p>
<p><img  id="XpjytZKadYHuY5Kqsnopd7" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XpjytZKadYHuY5Kqsnopd7.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen=""></p>
<h3>Is BT broadband any good?</h3>
<p>BT relies&#xA0;a lot on its enduring reputation as the most recognisable name in telecommunications, and it remains the most widely used broadband provider in the UK. But that doesn&apos;t necessarily equate to quality. Although it can offer competitive prices and bespoke internet, phone and TV packages, it often sits at the bottom of the list when it comes to customer satisfaction surveys.</p>
<p><img  id="XpjytZKadYHuY5Kqsnopd7" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XpjytZKadYHuY5Kqsnopd7.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen=""></p>
<h3>How to use the BT broadband checker?</h3>
<p>Much like our postcode checker above, BT has its own <a href="https://www.productsandservices.bt.com/products/speed-checker/" target="_blank">broadband checker</a>. Pop in your address and phone number and it will let you know what speeds you can expect with BT internet and whether its Infinity broadband is available in your area. If fibre isn&apos;t yet available, you can sign up to BT&apos;s mailing list so that they&apos;ll give you a shout when the cables have been installed.</p>
<p><img  id="XpjytZKadYHuY5Kqsnopd7" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XpjytZKadYHuY5Kqsnopd7.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen=""></p>
<h3>How do I contact the BT broadband helpline?</h3>
<p>If you need help with your broadband or set-up, BT doesn&apos;t exactly make it easy for you to speak to them on the phone. It seems to prefer for you to go through its online support. But if you&apos;re determined to speak to a human, there is a 24/7 number available. Dial 0800-111-4567 if you&apos;re using a landline in the UK, 0330-123-4567 from your mobile or +44179-359-6931 if you&apos;re out of the country.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>We now know when the Note 8 will arrive thanks to a confirmed launch event by Samsung. </description>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Update: </strong><em>A complete specs list leak has seemingly revealed almost everything about the Galaxy Note 8, from the screen to the camera and internal specs. We&apos;re also hearing that while the phone will probably be announced in late August you might not be able to buy it until September 15.</em></p>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy Note 8 is the biggest comeback story in phones following all of the disastrous <a href="http://www.techradar.com/reviews/phones/mobile-phones/samsung-galaxy-note-7-1325876/review"><ins>Galaxy Note 7</ins></a> battery failures last year.</p><p>And now that our <a href="http://www.techradar.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s8-review">Galaxy S8</a> and <a href="http://www.techradar.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s8-plus-review">Galaxy S8 Plus</a> reviews are up, we&apos;re focused on what next&apos;s for Samsung&apos;s S Pen-equipped smartphone and its launch date.</p><p>It&apos;s fascinating: The Note 7 will go down in smartphone history for all the wrong reasons, yet when it wasn&apos;t causing property damage or injuries, it was among the <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/20-best-mobile-phones-in-the-world-today-645440">best phones</a> you could buy.&#xA0;That honor was short-lived.</p><p>Where does Samsung go from here? We now have a better idea of the Galaxy Note 8 features thanks to the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus launch. They look and feel like Note phones (read: really big) without that all-important S Pen.</p><p>Samsung will build on top of its new all-screen technology, and the Note series will continue to be Samsung&apos;s high-end, at times experimental smartphone.</p><p>When it will launch and how much will it cost? Here&apos;s the latest rumors we&apos;ve been hearing about non-stop.</p>
<h3>Cut to the chase</h3>
<ul ><li><strong>What is it?</strong> Samsung&apos;s next flagship phablet</li><li><strong>When is it out?</strong> August 23 announcement, possibly a September 15 release</li><li><strong>What will it cost?</strong> A lot, the Note 7 cost $850/&#xA3;749/AU$1,349</li></ul>
<h3>Samsung Galaxy Note 8 release date</h3>
<figure class=pull-left><p><img  id="b8uAA4gZc6ATLjYqTwcoEb" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/b8uAA4gZc6ATLjYqTwcoEb.jpg" align="left" fullscreen="" class="pull-left"></p><figcaption class=pull-left>(Photo Credit: Evan Blass)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung is going to announce the Galaxy Note 8 on August 23, according to the official invite sent to the media a month in advance.</p><p>When will it actually be in your hands? The company recently <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/samsung-galaxy-note-8-confirmed-for-launch-next-month">hinted</a> at an early September release date in some countries, with others getting it in October.</p><p>More specifically we&apos;ve now heard from both an analyst and a South Korean carrier that the Note 8 will <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/you-may-have-to-wait-three-weeks-after-launch-to-buy-the-galaxy-note-8">hit stores on September 15</a>.</p><p>That makes sense, as we&apos;ve become accustomed to seeing a new S Pen-compatible Android phone every autumn.&#xA0;</p><p>It also more or less lines up with earlier rumors, as trusted source <a href="http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20170607000714" target="_blank">The Korea Herald</a> has reported the Galaxy Note 8 will come out in August in order to beat the <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/iphone-8-1329124">iPhone 8</a> to market.</p>
<ul ><li><strong>Pre-register for Samsung Galaxy Note 8</strong></li><li><strong>UK:</strong> <a href="https://www.carphonewarehouse.com/samsung/the-next-galaxy.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Carphone Warehouse</a></li></ul>
<p>In the UK, network carrier EE has already confirmed it will the selling the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 when it goes on sale and you can <a href="http://shop.ee.co.uk/new-phones-coming-soon" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">register your interest on its website</a>.</p>
<p><strong>TechRadar&#x2019;s take:</strong> The Note 8 will officially be announced on Wednesday, August 23, while it could hit stores starting on September 15. The good news is that the US, UK and Australia are very likely to be in the first wave instead of having to wait until October.</p>
<h3>Samsung Galaxy Note 8 screen</h3>
<p><strong>Hottest leaks:</strong></p>
<ul ><li><strong>A QHD+ screen</strong></li><li><strong>6.3-inch screen size likely</strong></li><li><strong>Another &apos;Infinity Display&apos;</strong></li></ul>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy Note 8 may once again make the Note series known for its groundbreaking screen, but not just because of its size this time around.</p><p>It&apos;s possible that the Note 8 will be one of the first smartphones with a pixel-dense 4K screen, with convincing <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/samsung-galaxy-note-8-isnt-dead-and-could-take-mobile-vr-to-the-next-level">rumors</a> backing up that theory.</p><p>Why do you need a 4K resolution on a phone? You don&apos;t when it&apos;s in your hand; the Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus look good enough paired down to Full HD 1080p in its battery saving mode.</p><p>But a 4K screen is important when your phone doubles as a <a href="http://www.techradar.com/reviews/samsung-gear-vr-2017">Samsung Gear VR</a> headset screen. Otherwise, you&apos;ll see individual pixels (that&apos;s what we call the screen door effect) when it&apos;s just two inches from your face.</p><p>Though this theory is looking ever less likely, with recent <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/take-note-these-could-be-the-samsung-galaxy-note-8s-final-specs">rumors</a> pointing to a 1440 x 2960 screen, just like the Galaxy S8.</p>
<ul ><li><a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/the-samsung-galaxy-note-8-has-to-have-a-4k-screen"><strong>The Samsung Galaxy Note 8 has to have a 4K screen</strong></a></li></ul>
<p>What about the Note 8 screen size? The phone series has stuck to a 5.7-inch screen ever since the Note 3, but it&apos;ll almost certainly break from tradition.</p><p>A 6.3-inch Samsung Galaxy Note 8 is more likely, because the Galaxy S8 Plus has reached 6.2 inches. It&apos;s really hard to see it being any smaller than that, and the <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/take-note-these-could-be-the-samsung-galaxy-note-8s-final-specs">latest leaks</a> also point to a 6.3-inch 1440 x 2960 Super AMOLED display, with a super-widescreen 18.5:9 aspect ratio.</p><p>But an even bigger 6.4-inch screen is possible, and indeed has been <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/samsung-galaxy-note-8-could-have-a-better-dual-camera-than-the-iphone-7-plus">rumored</a>, with the source adding that it will be a QHD+ OLED display with minimal bezels, just like the S8 and S8 Plus.</p><p>Or maybe it will split the difference and have a 6.3-inch display, as has also been <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/youll-probably-have-to-save-up-a-lot-of-cash-to-afford-the-galaxy-note-8">rumored</a>.</p><p>It&apos;s also, unsurprisingly, likely to have an &apos;Infinity Display&apos;, an idea backed up by <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/photo-leaks-show-off-the-infinity-display-on-the-galaxy-note-8">a recent front display panel leak</a>. That&apos;s what Samsung calls the near bezel-free 18.5:9 display on the Galaxy S8, and it would make sense for a similar screen to be used on the Note 8. Not only would it make sense, but it&apos;s also been <a href="https://www.galaxyclub.nl/2017/06/samsung-galaxy-note-8-infinity-display-android-7-1-1" target="_blank">rumored</a>.&#xA0;</p>

<p>Samsung might go even further that maximize the screen-to-body ratio on the Note 8 though, with the <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/samsung-galaxy-note-8-images-suggest-the-fingerprint-scanner-will-be-built-into-the-screen">image above</a> suggesting the corners will be shrunk.</p><p>A picture <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/leaked-photo-gives-us-our-best-look-yet-at-the-galaxy-note-8">from the same source</a>, below, shows what could be our first proper look at the Galaxy Note 8 - but there&apos;s no way of knowing whether this is an official photo that&apos;s been leaked or a clever Photoshop.</p>

<p>Another rumor suggested that the Galaxy Note 8 could act as Samsung&apos;s first smartphone with a foldable screen. It&apos;s extremely unlikely, but a fun thought.</p><p>Samsung is <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/samsung-could-launch-two-foldable-phones-in-2017-1322849">rumored</a> to be readying two foldable phones for 2017. But we don&apos;t feel like it&apos;s due for a flagship phone just yet &#x2013; not this year at least. We&apos;ve seen patents for what could be the <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/the-samsung-galaxy-note-9-could-look-like-this">Galaxy Note 9</a>, too, but that&apos;s even further out</p>
<p><img  id="KBjj9wWJmGpWqDykewXn4V" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KBjj9wWJmGpWqDykewXn4V.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen=""></p>
<p>Instead of launching an overhauled Note this year, Samsung is said to be preparing a foldable <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/samsung-galaxy-x-the-story-of-samsungs-foldable-phone-so-far">Samsung Galaxy X</a> <em>prototype</em> &#x2013; not a phone ready for commercial launch.&#xA0;</p><p>At best, next year&apos;s Samsung Galaxy Note 9 could test the waters with a foldable variant, much like it tested curved screens with the <a href="http://www.techradar.com/reviews/phones/mobile-phones/samsung-galaxy-note-edge-1263718/review">Samsung Galaxy Note Edge</a>.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>TechRadar&#x2019;s take: </strong>The Note 8 will almost certainly continue Samsung&apos;s streak of debuting new technology in its second half of the year phone. At first it was bigger screens and S Pens, then the curved Galaxy Note Edge variant, and most recently the debut of Mobile HDR. What&apos;s next? A 4K resolution with expanded S Pen functionality at or around 6.3 inches could help differentiate this year&apos;s Note phone. Though the latest leaks suggest the resolution will stay at QHD+, so we wouldn&apos;t count on 4K.</p>
<h3>Samsung Galaxy Note 8 design</h3>
<p><strong>Hottest leaks:</strong></p>
<ul ><li><strong>Curved glass front and back</strong></li><li><strong>A camera bump</strong></li></ul>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy Note 8 design is likely to take almost all of its cues from the glass-and-metal sandwich that is the Galaxy S8 Plus. It&apos;s almost a Note phone &#x2013; minus the stylus.</p><p>Samsung&apos;s &apos;Infinity Display&apos; doesn&apos;t seem like a one-off marketing term. It&apos;s here to stay, and you can see how the screen and phone might look in the <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/our-first-proper-look-at-the-galaxy-note-8-paints-an-ugly-picture">renders</a> below.</p>
<p>These are apparently based on a factory CAD and indeed they show a Galaxy S8-like design, with a cruved glass front and back and almost no bezels. But they also include an ugly camera bump and the dimensions point to a chunky phone that comes in at 162.4 x 74.5 x 8.4mm, going up to 9.5mm on the camera bump.</p><p>We&apos;re not convinced the final design would take such an ugly form, so hopefully we&apos;ll see some more polished leaks over the coming weeks and months.</p><p>One of those leaks comes <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/galaxy-note-8-may-have-just-appeared-on-samsungs-twitter">directly from Samsung</a>. The company published a tweet promoting the new Exynos 8895 processor, which is expected to be inside the Note 8, and it&apos;s placed on a phone that may be the Galaxy Note 8.</p><p>There&apos;s a smaller bezel than the Galaxy S8 or S8 Plus while there are no buttons on the side, which may suggest this is just a dummy unit. You can see the image of the phone in the tweet below:</p>
<p>Most recently though, case maker Ghostek has <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/samsung-galaxy-note-8-render-provides-a-teasing-look-at-the-phablet">revealed full renders</a> of what it expects the Galaxy Note 8 to look like.</p><p>There&apos;s no guarantee that these interpretations are on the money, and it&apos;s not clear how much knowledge Ghostek has of the Note 8&apos;s development - so take it with a pinch of salt.</p><p>That said, if they are accurate we&apos;re basically looking at an even larger Galaxy S8 Plus, with the addition of a second camera on the rear and a slot for the S-Pen on the base.</p>
<figure><p><img  id="ncvve4MqKoSmBx9hFiAwGG" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ncvve4MqKoSmBx9hFiAwGG.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen="1" class="expandable"></p><figcaption>Is this the final Galaxy Note 8 design? (credit: BGR)</figcaption></figure>
<p>In other news, instead of a physical home button, the Note 8 is <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/samsung-galaxy-s8-could-sport-3d-touch-like-pressure-sensitivity">rumored</a> to have a pressure-sensitive screen that brings up different menus and options depending on how hard you press the display. The S8 and S8 Plus have this, but it&apos;s limited to the home button.</p><p>More than cloning Apple&apos;s 3D Touch screen technique, however, we&apos;re hoping that Samsung figures out a way to embed a fingerprint sensor in the screen. One of the latest <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/samsung-galaxy-note-8-may-finally-embed-the-fingerprint-scanner-under-the-screen">leaks of a prototype</a> device suggests the company may have found a way to do it as there&apos;s no sign of a physical fingerprint scanner.</p><p>The S8 and S8 Plus shifted the fingerprint scanner to the back, awkwardly next to the camera lens. Cue the smudges.&#xA0;</p><p>But returning it to the front, under the display, would be ideal placement when such technology is ready - though <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/samsung-galaxy-note-8-could-have-a-better-dual-camera-than-the-iphone-7-plus">rumors suggest</a> it may not be ready in time, and leaked images such as the renders above show it on the back.</p><p><strong>TechRadar&#x2019;s take:</strong> The Note 8 design may not look too different from glass-and-metal Galaxy S8 Plus at 6.2 inches. We&apos;re bullish on that. We&apos;re hoping to see more rumors about a fingerprint sensor embedded in the front glass. It&apos;s an idea that&apos;ll be in Samsung&apos;s near future, if not the Note 8.</p>
<h3>Samsung Galaxy Note 8 colors</h3>
<p>So you want to buy a Samsung Galaxy Note 8 already, right? Chances are &apos;Yes,&apos; if you&apos;re this far down the page. Next question: Which color will you get?</p>
<figure><p><img  id="qieDrvg5GCZx8RWzMbFGf7" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qieDrvg5GCZx8RWzMbFGf7.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen=""></p><figcaption>The S8 colors, though is varied by region</figcaption></figure>
<p>We&apos;re keeping tabs on the list of <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/samsung-galaxy-note-8-colors-all-the-shades-rumored-so-far">Samsung Galaxy Note 8 colors</a>, and expect to see a Midnight Black, Maple Gold, Deep Sea Blue and Orchid Grey.</p><p>You should remember that not all colors launch worldwide. The US got some muted tones for the S8, and Samsung recently launched Coral Blue months after the phone came out. It&apos;s a plot to spur new sales by doesn&apos;t help early adopters at all.</p>
<h3>Samsung Galaxy Note 8 camera</h3>
<p><strong>Hottest leaks:</strong></p>
<ul ><li>A dual-lens camera</li><li>2x optical zoom</li><li>Telephoto and wide-angle lenses</li></ul>
<p>Samsung&apos;s camera is due for an upgrade, and the Galaxy Note 8 is Samsung&apos;s playground to try new things.</p><p>The 12MP sensor stayed the same from the Galaxy S7, S7 Edge and Note 7 to the Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus. Samsung <em>promised</em> it tweaked the software. Okay.</p><p>But we still anticipate seeing something different from the Note 8, and that could come in the form of a dual-lens camera, especially as exactly that has now been <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/samsung-galaxy-note-8-could-have-a-better-dual-camera-than-the-iphone-7-plus">rumored</a> by respected analyst Ming Chi Kuo.</p>
<p><img  id="Z2mj9D8qgwCLAoEmgBy84Y" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9e0dfed1aa1654c334ab265dfc8b09d3.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen=""></p>
<p>Supposedly, the Galaxy Note 8 will have a 12MP wide-angle lens and a 13MP telephoto one, and you&apos;ll be able to combine them for a 3x optical zoom.</p><p>Those specs match up with <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/note-8-tipped-to-come-with-samsungs-best-smartphone-camera-yet">some information spotted</a> on Samsung&apos;s semiconductor website.</p><p>More recently we&apos;ve heard from <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/take-note-these-could-be-the-samsung-galaxy-note-8s-final-specs">trusted leaker Evan Blass</a> that it will have two 12MP sensors, with the secondary one being an f/2.4 aperture telephoto lens capable of 2x optical zoom.</p><p>And it all sounds a lot like the setup on the <a href="http://www.techradar.com/reviews/phones/mobile-phones/iphone-7-plus-1327948/review">iPhone 7 Plus</a>, which allows for a 2x optical zoom, though hopefully you&apos;ll also be able to use the sensors independently like on the <a href="http://www.techradar.com/reviews/lg-g6">LG G6</a>.</p><p>Kuo adds that both cameras will also have optical image stabilization, and we also fully expect a 5MP to 8MP front-facing upgrade given that the Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus got that spec boost along with selfie auto-focus.</p><p>Elsewhere we&apos;ve <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/youll-probably-have-to-save-up-a-lot-of-cash-to-afford-the-galaxy-note-8">heard</a> that the Note 8 could get dual 12MP snappers.</p><p>We&apos;ve also now <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/samsung-galaxy-note-8-images-suggest-the-fingerprint-scanner-will-be-built-into-the-screen">seen a render</a> showing dual lenses on the back of the Note 8, so this is looking likely.</p><p><strong>TechRadar&#x2019;s take:</strong> We&apos;re fully expecting Samsung to jump on the dual-lens camera bandwagon sooner or later, and as a flagship phone the Note 8 seems an ideal candidate.</p>
<h3>Samsung Galaxy Note 8 battery</h3>
<p><strong>Hottest leaks:</strong></p>
<ul ><li>A 3,300mAh battery</li></ul>
<p>Wow. Here&apos;s a touchy subject for you. The Note 8 battery has to be big, in the ballpark of 3,500mAh, like Samsung&apos;s current crop of phones.</p><p>Samsung could technically go bigger &#x2013; Asus Zenfone Max has a 5,000mAh battery. But we don&apos;t expect a such fightingly bigger number.</p><p>The Note 8 battery not only has to be safe, it has to look safe. 5,000mAh doesn&apos;t look safe. Plus, Samsung packs in a lot more internal technology.</p><p>The Note 7 findings confirmed that the explosions were the result of two different battery failures. So we expect Samsung to play it cool with a smaller battery capacity than it could technically go with.</p><p>In fact, it might be very conservative with the size, as one <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/our-first-proper-look-at-the-galaxy-note-8-paints-an-ugly-picture">rumor</a> points to just a 3,300mAh juice pack, and that&apos;s since been backed up by <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/take-note-these-could-be-the-samsung-galaxy-note-8s-final-specs">another source</a>.</p>
<ul ><li><a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/samsung-galaxy-note-7-battery-fires-heres-why-they-exploded">Everything we know about the Note 7 fire</a></li></ul>
<h3>Samsung Galaxy Note 8 OS and power</h3>
<p><strong>Hottest leaks:</strong></p>
<ul ><li>A Snapdragon 835 or Exynos 8895 chipset</li><li>6GB of RAM</li><li>64GB and 128GB sizes</li></ul>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy Note 8 specs are likely to reflect those of the S8 and S8 Plus, but may finally include a boost in RAM.</p>
<p><img  id="P26QJkVXb4LC7fizdEDjqG" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/P26QJkVXb4LC7fizdEDjqG.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen=""></p>
<p>Samsung&apos;s newest flagship phones premiered in two chipset flavors: The Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 in the US and its own Exynos 8895 in the UK and other regions. The fact that Samsung is manufacturing both doesn&apos;t hurt the chances that they&apos;ll continue on to the Note 8, and indeed an Exynos 8895 has been <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/samsung-galaxy-note-8-could-have-a-better-dual-camera-than-the-iphone-7-plus">rumored for the phone</a>.</p><p>Here&apos;s the difference: It may jump from 4GB of RAM to 6GB of RAM. We were surprised to see Samsung didn&apos;t make a 6GB Galaxy S8 for the West, although it is launching that exact model in China.</p><p>A Note 8 with 6GB of RAM isn&apos;t out of the question then, and has even been <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/youll-probably-have-to-save-up-a-lot-of-cash-to-afford-the-galaxy-note-8">rumored</a>. More memory means more apps can be open at once, and Samsung is boasting that the large screen is great for multitasking.</p><p>And there could be plenty of space for apps too, with an unnamed Samsung official <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/samsung-galaxy-note-8-could-double-up-on-storage">reportedly saying</a> that the Note 8 will come in both 64GB and 128GB storage sizes - the latter being double the capacity of most Samsung flagships.</p><p>Most recently we&apos;ve heard that the reportedly <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/take-note-these-could-be-the-samsung-galaxy-note-8s-final-specs">&apos;final&apos; specs</a> of the phone include a Snapdragon 835 (in the US), an Exynos 8895 (everywhere else), 6GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, along with a microSD card slot.</p><p>As for software, Samsung renamed TouchWiz to &apos;Samsung Experience,&apos; and it&apos;s actually likable. We expect a further refined operating system overlay based on Android Nougat, more specifically Android 7.1.1 if <a href="https://www.galaxyclub.nl/2017/06/samsung-galaxy-note-8-infinity-display-android-7-1-1" target="_blank">rumors are to be believed</a>.&#xA0;</p><p>Wanting Android O on the Note 8 is wishful thinking, as that&apos;s likely being saved for the <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/google-pixel-2">Google Pixel 2</a>, which is expected to launch later. Indeed, a <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/2017/06/15/galaxy-note-8-running-android-7-1-1-spotted-in-html5test-database/" target="_blank">new benchmark</a> again points to Android 7.1.1 for the Galaxy Note 8 - though it&apos;s sure to get updated to Android O once that&apos;s available.</p><p><strong>TechRadar&#x2019;s take: </strong>The Note 8 chipset may not change from what we saw in the S8 and S8 Plus, but it can differentiate itself with the long-awaited 6GB of RAM upgrade. This will further Samsung&apos;s drive toward multitasking on the phone and DeX desktop accessory.</p>
<h3>Samsung Galaxy Note 8 other features</h3>
<p><strong>Hottest leaks:</strong></p>
<ul ><li>A stylus with a speaker</li><li>A fingerprint scanner built into the screen</li><li>An iris scanner</li><li>Bixby AI 2.0</li></ul>
<p>Like the Galaxy S8 before it we&apos;re <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/samsung-galaxy-note-8-images-suggest-the-fingerprint-scanner-will-be-built-into-the-screen">hearing rumors</a> that the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 could have a fingerprint scanner built into the screen. But will it happen this time? The render below backs the theory up, and also points to audio tuned by AKG, so the Note 8 could put a focus on sound.</p>
<p><img  id="yK7BXrMNRVqSuwMzTLWAPS" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yK7BXrMNRVqSuwMzTLWAPS.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen=""></p>
<p>However, a Samsung official has <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/samsung-official-says-the-galaxy-note-8-wont-have-an-in-screen-fingerprint-scanner">reportedly said</a> that the Note 8 won&apos;t have an in-screen fingerprint scanner as the company couldn&apos;t perfect the technology in time, so that&apos;s looking like an unlikely feature, despite the image above.</p><p>One <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/samsung-galaxy-note-8-may-have-solved-the-galaxy-s8s-fingerprint-problem">render of the phone</a> suggests the scanner will sit in a similar position to where it did on the Galaxy S8, but slightly away from the camera to make sure you don&apos;t smudge it when you miss the sensor.</p><p>The S Pen meanwhile is a Galaxy Note 8 essential &#x2013; it&apos;s why some people are holding off on buying the S8 and S8 Plus. Good things may come to those who wait.</p><p>The S Pen stylus could come with a built-in speaker, according to <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/samsung-s-galaxy-note-8-s-pen-might-speak-to-you-1329439">a new patent</a>. What the speaker does isn&apos;t clear. It could very well read notes back to you. We&apos;ve also heard that it might be able to vibrate.</p><p>Samsung has changed up its S Pen on the <a href="http://www.techradar.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-tab-s3">Galaxy Tab S3</a>, so it has not been afraid to make it different (in the case of the Tab S3&apos;s it&apos;s much bigger).</p>
<p><img  id="8pMh59aeYGCpiMjThuHZxg" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8pMh59aeYGCpiMjThuHZxg.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen=""></p>
<p>You can bet we&apos;ll see an iris scanner in the Note 8. This unique phone unlocking method debuted in the Note 7 and made its way to the S8 and S8 Plus.</p><p>However, we may see a more secure Galaxy Note 8 given recent reports that a <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/samsung-galaxy-s8-iris-scanner-hack">group of hackers</a> were able to bypass the iris scanner. Time to improve the tech.</p><p>It&apos;ll also inherit dust and water resistance with a rating of IP68, have a microSD card slot for expandable storage and Fast Charge via USB-C and wireless charge, too.</p><p>Samsung <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/samsungs-own-site-confirms-bixby-ai-assistant">confirmed</a> that it intends to expand its Bixby virtual assistant beyond the S8 and S8 Plus, so the Note 8 is a prime candidate for its Siri rival. Give it a couple months and it&apos;ll be much better &#x2013; just in time for the Note 8 release date.</p><p>There&apos;s <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/samsung-could-bundle-its-own-airpod-competitors-with-the-note-8">even talk</a> that Samsung plans to have a Bixby-powered pair of AirPod competitors ready for the Note 8 launch - so you might be able to get some high-quality, smart, wireless earbuds with your phablet.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>TechRadar&#x2019;s take:</strong> With Samsung Galaxy Note 8, you&apos;re going to get &apos;everything you see here&apos; from the S8 and S8 Plus, and they&apos;re throwing in the S Pen. That means an iris scanner, dust and water resistant, fast wireless charging and Bixby AI are also expected in the new phone.</p>
<h3>Samsung Galaxy Note 8 price</h3>
<p><strong>Hottest leaks:</strong></p>
<ul ><li>Could cost over $1,000</li></ul>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy Note 8 is shaping up to sound like the S8 Plus, but better. Of course, that means it&apos;ll likely be more pricey.</p><p>Noted leaker Evan Blass says <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/youll-probably-have-to-save-up-a-lot-of-cash-to-afford-the-galaxy-note-8">the phablet will launch</a> with a sticker price of &#x20AC;999 (roughly $1,120/&#xA3;875/AU$1,475), so you&apos;d better start saving.</p><p>We&apos;ve heard a <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/samsung-galaxy-note-8-could-double-up-on-storage">similar price</a> of between $1,000 (around &#xA3;770/AU$1,300) and $1,200 (roughly &#xA3;920/AU$1,560) from a site supposedly quoting a Samsung official.</p><p>Considering the <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/samsung-galaxy-s8-price">Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus price</a> is $824.99 (&#xA3;779, $1,349), you&apos;re almost certainly looking at a slight cost increase for the S Pen and expected 6GB of RAM. The Note 7 launched at $850 (&#xA3;749, AU$1,349) &#x2013; more than the S8 Plus in the US, less in the UK and exactly the same in Australia.</p><p><strong>TechRadar&#x2019;s take: </strong>The Galaxy Note 8 is sure to be expensive, but probably won&#x2019;t be much more than the Note 7 or S8 Plus, whichever is higher in your region.</p>
<h3>Should you wait for the Note 8?</h3>
<p>Samsung Galaxy Note 8 is built for S Pen users who refuse to work on their phone without a stylus. For these people, it&apos;s worth the wait.</p>
<p><img  id="vBgg2buy4dhw2RpSFq6hfm" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vBgg2buy4dhw2RpSFq6hfm.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen=""></p>
<p>However, you&apos;re not going to miss much by checking out the Galaxy S8 Plus. It already has a 6.2-inch screen that tops the size of every Note phone before it.</p><p>Other perks we expect in the Note 8 are 6GB of RAM and a 4K display for a leap in Samsung Gear VR gaming that demands extra pixels. Don&apos;t need a stylus? Don&apos;t need a high-end VR headset? The S8 Plus is plenty of phone for you.</p>

<p>Aside from distinctly fewer flames and explosions, there are a number of other things we’d like from the Samsung Galaxy Note 8, and the following are our top wants.</p>
<h3>1. A lower price</h3>
<p>For the brief period that it was on sale, the <a href="http://www.techradar.com/reviews/phones/mobile-phones/samsung-galaxy-note-7-1325876/review">Samsung Galaxy Note 7</a> was colossally expensive, coming in at $850/£749/AU$1,349 if you bought it off contract.</p><p>The size and specs of the phone went a long way towards justifying that price, but it still put the phone out of many people’s reach, so we’d like to see a lower price for the Note 8.</p><p>It’s unlikely, but you never know, Samsung might drop the price as a goodwill gesture to all its fans that have had to go without an upgrade in 2016.</p>
<h3>2. 6GB of RAM</h3>
<p>Most current smartphones have 4GB of RAM, but a few, such as the <a href="http://www.techradar.com/reviews/phones/mobile-phones/oneplus-3-1323353/review">OnePlus 3</a>, have launched with 6GB, and a Chinese variant of the Note 7 was supposed to do the same.</p><p>With the Note 8, we’d like to see all versions launch with at least that much. It might sound like overkill, but it would help power VR experiences, and besides, the Note series has always been at the cutting edge.</p>
<h3>3. A 4K display</h3>
<p><img  id="K3WVD7nsBQKXjKPQ4vLjYD" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8423c52205658001cc53697615c7d008.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen=""></p>
<p>What would help VR even more than extra RAM is a sharper screen, and so we’d like to see a 4K display on the Galaxy Note 8.</p><p>Samsung has been peddling QHD screens for a while now, and with the extra size of the Note it’s a prime candidate for a few more pixels.</p>
<h3>4. Less sensitive buttons</h3>
<p>It’s a minor niggle, but the capacitive buttons on the Note 7, and indeed many Samsung handsets, are overly sensitive, leading to many an accidental press, particularly for those who are new to the handset, so we’d like to see these made slightly less sensitive for the Note 8 – but only slightly!</p>
<h3>5. A foldable screen</h3>
<p><img  id="MtBzFgmaVJbV4Y4AhUGR2Z" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MtBzFgmaVJbV4Y4AhUGR2Z.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen=""></p>
<p>There’s <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/samsung-could-launch-two-foldable-phones-in-2017-1322849">been talk</a> that Samsung could start launching handsets with foldable screens in 2017. So, could the Note 8 be one of them? It’s unlikely, but it seems like a natural evolution from the curved screens we have now, and would make the phone’s sheer size more manageable.</p>
<h3>6. No more bezels</h3>
<p>OK, a foldable screen might be asking a bit much, but Samsung could at least ditch the bezels surrounding the display. That could allow the company to either pack a larger screen into the same space, or shrink the handset size down.</p><p>Ditching the home button could prove problematic, since it houses the fingerprint scanner, but there have been rumors that Samsung might build the scanner into the screen itself.</p>
<h3>7. A new design</h3>
<p>Samsung has been iterating on the current design of its phones since the <a href="http://www.techradar.com/reviews/phones/mobile-phones/samsung-galaxy-s6-1285636/review">Galaxy S6</a>, so by the time the Note 8 launches it will be about time for a shakeup.</p><p>We want the curved screen to stay, unless the alternative is a foldable one, but a change to that metal and glass sandwich would be appreciated, as long as it still looks just as stylish and premium.</p>
<ul ><li>Can&apos;t wait for the Note 8? We&apos;ll likely get a <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/samsung-galaxy-s8-edge-1318837">Samsung Galaxy S8 Edge</a> first</li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

<h3>TalkTalk broadband packages compared - what broadband speed can I get with TalkTalk?</h3>
<p>It&apos;s one of the trickier decisions you&apos;ll have to make when choosing your broadband deal - do you save money with standard ADSL or splash the extra on a superfast <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/fibre-broadband-deals">fibre broadband package</a>? Your options on TalkTalk are as follows:</p>
<p><img  id="9mtmJpnJDRjvZhRJk7DUYL" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9mtmJpnJDRjvZhRJk7DUYL.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen=""></p>
<p><strong>TalkTalk Fast Broadband</strong></p><p>To be honest, the name is slightly misleading here. TalkTalk&apos;s so-called Fast Broadband is no quicker than any other standard ADSL 17Mb (around 2.1MB per second) internet connection. But TalkTalk is invariably around the cheapest providers on the market. TalkTalk Fast Broadband includes:</p>
<ul ><li>Up to 17Mb speed</li><li>Super Router</li><li>Unlimited data usage</li><li>Super-Safe antivirus from F-Secure</li></ul>
<p><img  id="9mtmJpnJDRjvZhRJk7DUYL" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9mtmJpnJDRjvZhRJk7DUYL.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen=""></p>
<p><strong>TalkTalk Faster Broadband</strong></p><p>If there are several members in your household who all use the internet simultaneously, it&apos;s well worth the extra few pounds a month to upgrade to TalkTalk&apos;s superfast fibre optic offering - Faster Broadband. That way, you reduce the chance of being frustrated by laggy video streams, slow downloads and sluggish web surfing. It&apos;s not available everywhere however, so use our postcode checker at the top of the page to see whether fibre is available where you live. TalkTalk Faster Broadband includes:</p>
<ul ><li>Up to 38Mb speed&#xA0;</li><li>Super Router</li><li>Unlimited data usage</li><li>Super-Safe antivirus from F-Secure</li></ul>
<p><img  id="9mtmJpnJDRjvZhRJk7DUYL" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9mtmJpnJDRjvZhRJk7DUYL.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen=""></p>
<p>&#xA0;<strong>TalkTalk Faster Fibre Broadband with Speed Boost</strong></p><p>Upgrade to Speed Boost and take your broadband up to 76Mb - that&apos;s not far off 10MB per second! This has to be your choice if you intend to stream 4K TV and films. Go for this package and you can more or less forget any concerns about interrupted internet use, regardless of how many people are trying to access it at once. Faster Fibre Broadband with Speed Boost includes:</p>
<ul ><li>Up to 76Mb speed&#xA0;</li><li>Super Router</li><li>Unlimited data usage</li><li>Super-Safe antivirus from F-Secure</li></ul>

<h3>What TalkTalk TV packages can I add to broadband?</h3>
<p>Its internet and fibre deals may be cheap enough on their own, but some TalkTalk TV offers make the provider really worth considering if you want a one-stop shop for broadband and TV.</p><p><strong>TalkTalk TV</strong> This basic plan is basically just the regular 80-odd channels that you get on Freeview. So if you already have Freeview integrated into your TV or via a set-top box, then we wouldn&apos;t advise paying extra for this from TalkTalk.</p><p><strong>TalkTalk TV Plus </strong>TV Plus adds Sky&apos;s basic suite of channels. So on top of the regular Freeview content, you also get Sky 1 and 2, Sky Arts, Sky Living and Sky Sports News.</p><p><strong>Sky Sports and Sky Cinema Boost</strong> Here&apos;s where things get really interesting. TalkTalk has got superb pricing on these two premium TV options. Add the spree of Sky Sports OR Sky Cinema channels and get the whole lot for less than &#xA3;30 (if you go for 17Mb speeds).</p><p><a href="https://www.talktalk.co.uk/shop/tv-and-broadband" target="_blank"><strong>Click to order TalkTalk broadband and TV now</strong></a></p>

<figure class=pull-left><p><img  id="ZPThZsJiV7dn7zW6iAaHr4" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZPThZsJiV7dn7zW6iAaHr4.jpg" align="left" fullscreen="" class="pull-left"></p></figure>
<h3>What is the TalkTalk Super Router?</h3>
<p>No matter which TalkTalk broadband plan you opt for, you&apos;ll be sent the standard TalkTalk router - the grand sounding TalkTalk Super Router. It&apos;s delivered free of charge and TalkTalk describes it as featuring the &#x201C;best performance in class&#x201D;.&#xA0;</p>
<p><img  id="9mtmJpnJDRjvZhRJk7DUYL" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9mtmJpnJDRjvZhRJk7DUYL.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen=""></p>

<h3>How long will my TalkTalk broadband contract last?</h3>
<p>TalkTalk gives you a little bit more flexibility than some other providers. You can choose from 12, 18 or 24-month contracts. And TalkTalk guarantees your monthly tariff for the entire course of the contract, so it&apos;s potentially worth going for a longer contract if you can bag a <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/black-friday-2017">Black Friday</a>-esque price. That said, it tends to keep its best prices for 18-month deals.</p>
<p><img  id="9mtmJpnJDRjvZhRJk7DUYL" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9mtmJpnJDRjvZhRJk7DUYL.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen=""></p>
<figure class=pull-left><p><img  id="DwshEpHunkS7eWEi3mhwGa" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DwshEpHunkS7eWEi3mhwGa.jpg" align="left" fullscreen="" class="pull-left"></p></figure>
<h3>Do I get a TalkTalk landline?</h3>
<p>You do indeed. Every TalkTalk broadband package comes with a landline included in the price. And it throws in free call privacy features as well, including caller display, anonymous caller reject and last caller barring.&#xA0;</p><p>TalkTalk doesn&apos;t have the usual array of different calling plans that other providers offer. But you can add Unlimited UK Calls - giving as many calls as you like to UK mobiles and landlines - or choose from one of three international call packages.</p><p>If you&apos;re worried that you&apos;ll have to change telephone number when you switch to TalkTalk, there&apos;s really no need to be. Like most other providers (e.g. BT, Sky, Plusnet, etc), TalkTalk uses an Openreach landline. And if you were previously with Virgin, it&apos;s easy to &apos;port&apos; your number over.</p>
<p><img  id="9mtmJpnJDRjvZhRJk7DUYL" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9mtmJpnJDRjvZhRJk7DUYL.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen=""></p>

<h3>Can I add TalkTalk mobile?</h3>
<p>This is a <em>very</em> easy one to answer - it&apos;s a big, fat NO. Or at least not at the moment. TalkTalk isn&apos;t currently doing mobile contracts, but its website suggests that it isn&apos;t far away on the horizon. We&apos;re hoping that when it does, TalkTalk will follow the likes of <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/ee-phone-deals-1296628">Vodafone</a> and <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/ee-phone-deals-1296628">EE</a> by offering discounts if you take both services.</p>

<h3>Which broadband and TV packages have Sky Atlantic?</h3>
<p>You don&apos;t need us to tell you that we&apos;re in a Golden Age for television drama and box sets. <a href="https://www.sky.com/watch/channel/sky-atlantic" target="_blank">Sky Atlantic</a> is the network&apos;s way to make the most of the small screen&apos;s new wave of high-quality broadcasting from the US.

<h3>Can I get BT Sport with my broadband and TV package?</h3>
<p>Until the end of July, <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/bt-broadband-deals">BT Infinity and broadband deals</a> come with BT Sport for absolutely free. That all changes on 1 August when you&apos;ll have to pay &#xA3;3.50 per month to enjoy <a href="http://sport.bt.com/" target="_blank">BT Sport&apos;s</a> exclusive coverage of Premiership and Champions League football, Premiership Rugby.</p><p>Virgin Media is the only other internet provider that allows you to add BT Sport to your broadband plan. You have to <a href="http://www.virginmedia.com/shop/bundles/player-btsport-bundle.html" target="_blank">add BT Sport to one of Virgin&apos;s broadband and TV bundles</a>.</p>
<p><img  id="LjLSChGcLAPXe7bWyy6TkX" name="" caption="" alt="best broadband deals" src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6055d9b3b185c0b87d5043eec55f7653.jpg" link="" align="" fullscreen=""></p>
<h3>What broadband speed do I need?</h3>
<figure class=pull-left><p><img  id="scTHSLogpgXKpjjXMpBw4L" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/scTHSLogpgXKpjjXMpBw4L.jpg" align="left" fullscreen="" class="pull-left"></p></figure>
<p>After you&apos;ve chosen what TV channels you want, the next thing to decide is how much to splash on the broadband element of the deal. Very simply, the faster the connection, the higher the monthly tariff, with the cheapest rates on standard ADSL internet.</p><p>If you rely on the internet for streaming or downloading TV, films and music, then it makes sense to pay a few quid more a month and go for a <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/fibre-broadband-deals">fibre broadband deal</a> instead. Learn more about the different available broadband speeds and which you may need below.</p><p><strong>0-25Mb</strong> The entry-level internet connection you can get is called ADSL, sometimes simply referred to as &apos;standard&apos;. It delivers speeds of up to 17Mb, which equates to &#xA0;just over 2MB per second. It best suits small households who want to surf the web, handle their emails and stream non-4k catch-up TV.</p><p><strong>25-50Mb </strong>Fibre broadband speeds start at up to 38Mb, so more than double what you get with standard ADSL. It&apos;s the sweet spot between fast speeds and good value and just the ticket for a family household where four or five members are all streaming, downloading and surfing at once.</p><p><strong>50+Mb </strong>You need to crank up the speeds if you want to, say, stream 4K Ultra HD content TV and films. Most providers have speeds of 52MB and 76Mb, but only <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/virgin-broadband-deals">Virgin Media broadband</a> can offer 100Mb and over - that&apos;s an incredible 12.5MB per second.</p>
<p><img  id="VgyagGS9HpAEPUQtUJBfrg" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VgyagGS9HpAEPUQtUJBfrg.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen=""></p>

<h3>Can I get fibre broadband where I live?</h3>
<p>If you think superfast broadband is what you need for your home, there may be a slight snag. Most households can now get it, but there&apos;s still around 10% of UK homes that still can&apos;t get it - and that rises to 40% where Virgin cable connections are concerned. So be sure to type in your postcode in our fibre broadband checker above to see whether superfast internet deals are available in your part of the country.</p>
<p><img  id="LjLSChGcLAPXe7bWyy6TkX" name="" caption="" alt="best broadband deals" src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6055d9b3b185c0b87d5043eec55f7653.jpg" link="" align="" fullscreen=""></p>

<h3>What contract length should I go for?</h3>
<p>BT, Virgin and NOW all offer 18 month package deals, Sky does 12 monthers and TalkTalk gives the option between either. Virgin Media offers 30 day rolling contracts for broadband and TV contracts as well, but we wouldn&apos;t recommend them - the price shoots through the roof for these short term agreements.</p>
<p><img  id="LjLSChGcLAPXe7bWyy6TkX" name="" caption="" alt="best broadband deals" src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6055d9b3b185c0b87d5043eec55f7653.jpg" link="" align="" fullscreen=""></p>

<h3>Will I have to pay anything upfront for broadband and TV?</h3>
<p>Afraid so. Unless you manage to catch one of the providers during one heck of a good promotional offer, you&apos;ll always have at least something to pay up front. This can include the costs of delivering the router and set-top TV internet box, but the likes of Virgin and BT also charge an activation or set-up fee.</p><p>Expect to pay at least &#xA3;25 when you sign up for a TV and broadband &#xA0;deal, but it shouldn&apos;t cost you any more than around &#xA3;70 at the outset.</p>

<h3>BT broadband deals and speeds</h3>
<p><strong>BT Unlimited Broadband | Up to 17Mb</strong><br>
BT is still the most popular broadband provider in the UK.

Infinity is the name BT gives to its fibre optic broadband service. Infinity 1 gives speeds of up to 52Mb (around 6.5 MB per second download speed), which is faster than most other companies&apos; entry-level fibre.

<h3>Sky broadband deals and speeds</h3>
<p><strong>Sky Fibre | 38Mb-76Mb</strong><br>
Sky only lets you add TV channels if you go for one of its superfast broadband options. Sky Fibre is the cheapest plan, but be wise to the fact that you&apos;ll be limited to using, downloading and streaming up to 25GB of data per month. Pay more for Sky Fibre Unlimited, or extra still for Sky Fibre Max giving you up to 76Mb speed (around 9.5MB per second) and a Sky Q Hub router.</p><p><a href="http://www.sky.com/shop/tvandbroadband/bb/" target="_blank"><strong>View and compare Sky broadband and TV deals</strong></a></p>

<h3>Virgin broadband deals and speeds</h3>
<p><strong>Virgin VIVID fibre broadband | 100Mb-300Mb</strong><br>
Not currently available on Virgin&apos;s cheapest VIVID 50 plan, you can instead choose from 100Mb (12.5MB per second), 200Mb (25MB per second) or 300Mb (a jaw-dropping 37.5MB per second). If you&apos;re also into gaming, you can choose VIVID 200 Gamer instead, which has better upload speeds and surpasses online traffic management to give you full speed even at peak times.</p><p><a href="http://www.virginmedia.com/shop/bundles.html" target="_blank"><strong>View and compare Virgin broadband and TV deals</strong></a></p>

<h3>TalkTalk broadband deals and speeds</h3>
<p><strong>TalkTalk Fast Broadband</strong> <strong>| Up to 17Mb</strong><br>
Don&apos;t let the name fool you, TalkTalk&apos;s fast broadband offers only standard ADSL 17Mb speed. But you can now add a Sky Sports or Sky Cinema boost for around &#xA3;8 a month.</p><p><strong>TalkTalk Faster Fibre</strong> <strong>| Up to 38Mb-76Mb</strong><br>
TalkTalk&apos;s fibre optic broadband plans are some of the cheapest around. And with its maximum speed of around 9.5MB per second, you can pay extra for Speed Boost and a Super Router.</p><p><a href="https://www.talktalk.co.uk/shop/tv-and-broadband" target="_blank"><strong>View and compare TalkTalk broadband and TV deals</strong></a></p>

<h3>NOW TV broadband deals and speeds</h3>
<p><strong>Brilliant Broadband | Up to 17Mb<br>
</strong>We can&apos;t help thinking of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B12WBTFLK0Q" target="_blank">Paul Whitehouse</a> when we hear the name &apos;Brilliant Broadband&apos;. It&apos;s NOW TV&apos;s standard speed. Combine it with a TV plan and the prices can be very attractive indeed.</p><p><strong>Fab Fibre</strong> <strong>| Up to 38Mb</strong><br>
Like the above, Fab Fibre comes with the NOW TV Hub router. The speeds head rise to around 4.75MB per second, which should be more than enough for streaming, downloading and surfing without frustration.</p><p><a href="http://www.nowtv.com/broadband-and-tv" target="_blank"><strong>View and compare NOW TV broadband and TV deals</strong></a></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>Looking for a great deal on a PS4 or PS4 Pro?</description>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are some fantastic PS4 deals this week. Actually, we&apos;ve found multiple PS4 bundles for around &#xA3;250 with multiple games included - that&apos;s the same price for a PS4 on its own at most stores. These brand new PS4 bundles are selling fast though, so don&apos;t dawdle if you see a PS4 price you like. The new gold and silver PS4 Slims are out now too, so we&apos;ve rounded up the best deals for the new consoles.</p><p>On this page we&apos;ve listed the best cheap PS4 deals in the UK (<a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/gaming/consoles/ps4-pre-order-guide-prices-game-bundles-and-where-you-can-get-it-1319490"><strong>here&apos;s our US page</strong></a> and <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/the-best-australian-ps4-deals-this-month"><strong>here&apos;s our Australian page</strong></a>) so you can find all of the cheapest PS4 prices. Below you&apos;ll find all of the absolute cheapest standalone PS4 deals from UK retailers, followed by our pick of what we think are the bundle deals that offer the best value.&#xA0;We&apos;re seeing prices that rival the <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/black-friday-2017">Black Friday deals</a> right now to be honest.</p><p>The PS4 is currently available in a number of different forms. Directly below, you&apos;ll find the best deals for the new PS4 Slim which has come in to replace the original model with a slimmer design. You can still get the original PS4 and you&apos;ll find prices for those below the PS4 Slim deals. And at the bottom you&apos;ll see deals for the new PS4 Pro - the new fancy 4K model. If you&apos;re still torn, maybe you&apos;d prefer one of our <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/xbox-one-deals-uk">Xbox One deals</a>?</p>

<h3>The best PS4 Slim deals:</h3>
<p><strong>The PS4 Slim is... slimmer, quieter and smaller</strong></p><p>The new PS4 Slim launched in September 2016 for around &#xA3;259 (500GB) or &#xA3;310 (1TB). This new model has effectively replaced the original PS4 now. The console itself is smaller, lighter and more power efficient and the 500GB model is priced cheaper than the older PS4 nowadays, so you&apos;re not paying more for the refined tech. We&apos;d seriously advise you scroll down to the bundles further down this page as many of them are cheaper than buying the console on its own! The PS4 Slim is available in black or white.</p>
<p><img  id="ob9NuBa2iWbXUx47cWEQv9" name="" caption="" alt="cheap ps4 deals" src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fa7eb049c94f414958305b0a805b48b6.jpg" link="" align="" fullscreen=""></p>
<h3>The best PS4 deals</h3>
<p><strong>The original PS4 with optical out audio options</strong></p><p>These are the regular, older, full-sized PS4 deals. Expect to see a few tasty bargains as retailers clear space for the new PS4 Slim. Prices have been dropping naturally in recent months, so if you&apos;re not bothered about 4K visuals (get a PS4 Pro if you are) and are yet to pick up a PS4, you could find a fantastically cheap deal here. We&apos;re generally seeing this model get phased out with better deals to be found on the PS4 Slim above though.</p>
<h3>The best PS4 bundle deals this week...</h3>
<p>You'll often find that the most attractive way to get a cheap PS4 is with a bundle with extra hardware or extra games. These are the best PS4 bundle deals currently available in the UK – we update these deals on a regular basis.</p>

<h3>The best PS4 Pro deals:</h3>
<p><strong>The PS4 that offers 4K gaming and Netflix</strong></p><p>Essentially, the PS4 Pro is a 4K upgrade of the current PS4, rather than a &apos;next-gen&apos; console. The keywords to take in from the PS4 Pro are 4K and HDR. The new machine allows game developers to include 4K resolution and High Dynamic Range options in their games, so expect the like of Uncharted 4, Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare, Days Gone, Horizon: Zero Dawn and more to look even better on a HDR-enabled 4K TV. You&apos;ll also be able to stream 4K content from Netflix and Amazon. Want to get the right TV?

<p><strong>White PS4 Pro | Destiny 2 | &#xA3;399.99 @ Game</strong><br>
The PS4 Pro is finally getting a white version to launch alongside side Destiny 2. So far, we&apos;ve only seen it in this bundle with Bungie&apos;s upcoming sequel. At nearly &#xA3;400, it&apos;s not cheap as you can regularly get a black PS4 Pro with a few games for around &#xA3;350. Fingers crossed we see some more competitive deals by the time this one launches on September 6. So far, this is a Game exclusive in the UK.</p><p><strong>View this PS4 Pro deal: </strong><a href="http://www.game.co.uk/en/glacier-white-ps4-pro-destiny-2-bundle-only-at-game-2022435" target="_blank"><strong>White PS4 Pro and Destiny &#xA3;399.99 @ Game</strong></a></p>
<h3>Cheap PlayStation Plus deals</h3>
<p>If you&apos;re buying a PS4, you&apos;ll probably need a cheap PlayStation Plus deal too.

The default price for a year is &#xA3;40.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thanks to the likes of Virgin Media, BT Infinity and Sky Fibre, you can now wave goodbye to the nightmare of sluggish web browsing, interrupted catch-up TV and slow downloads. Faster fibre broadband is now more affordable and widely available than ever before - and we&apos;ve found the cheapest deals this side of <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/black-friday-2017">Black Friday</a>.</p><p>If you thought that the <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/broadband-deals">best broadband deals</a> were reserved for slower ADSL internet connections, think again. Fibre optic broadband is a bloody battleground for the major providers, which means frequently fantastic prices for the consumer. You can pick up <a href="http://www.mobiles4everyone.com/linkbb.asp?siteid=future&amp;dealid=plu128&amp;postcode=" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">unlimited fibre broadband from Plusnet for as little as &#xA3;24.99 per month</a>.</p><p>So check out our fibre broadband deals comparison chart above to pick out the package that suits you - whether you&apos;re after a fibre plan that includes TV channels, a flexible phone offer or simply fibre broadband internet on its own. Below we explain everything you need to know about fibre optic broadband - including fibre broadband availability - &#xA0;followed by more information on providers including BT Infinity, Sky, Virgin Media, EE and more.</p><p><strong>See also:</strong> <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/broadband-deals">Broadband deals</a> | <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/bt-broadband-deals">BT broadband deals</a> | <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/sky-broadband-deals">Sky broadband deals</a> | <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/virgin-broadband-deals">Virgin broadband deals</a></p>

<figure class=pull-left><p><img  id="XgDNbfTygmWSgqS58XPvV7" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XgDNbfTygmWSgqS58XPvV7.jpg" align="left" fullscreen="" class="pull-left"></p></figure>
<h3>What is fibre broadband?</h3>
<p>We don&apos;t want to get too technical here - the main thing to take from this is that fibre broadband is far faster than traditional ADSL internet. It uses fibre optic cables to send and receive data, resulting in a speedier, more reliable internet connection.</p><p>So instead of being stuck with maximum standard speeds of 17Mb, you can at least double that to 38Mb for download speeds of around 4.75MB per second. As well as facilitating ridiculously fast downloading, the extra speed is ideal for large households where lots of people are using the internet at once. If you stream 4K films and TV or play a lot of online games, fibre broadband is a must to ensure the highest-quality user experience.</p><p>All of the most popular providers - including Sky, TalkTalk, EE, Plusnet, Vodafone, John Lewis and the Post Office - offer a 38Mb fibre broadband plan, while BT goes one better. Its <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/bt-broadband-deals">BT infinity fibre broadband</a> starts at speeds of up to 52Mb (6.5MB per second).</p><p>If you&apos;re wondering why we haven&apos;t mentioned <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/virgin-broadband-deals">Virgin Media broadband</a> yet, it&apos;s because its super fast service is slightly different again. It uses coaxial cable instead of copper fibre optics to connect your home to the exchange. That basically means even faster internet speeds for you - between 50Mb (6.25 MB per second) and an incredible 300Mb (37.5 MB per second).</p>

<h3>Fibre broadband checker - is fibre broadband available in my area?</h3>
<p>There&apos;s one extremely easy way to discover whether fibre broadband is available where you live - head to the top of this page, type in your postcode, hit &apos;compare deals&apos;, and if any results come back then you can indeed get fibre. Fibre and cable broadband is currently available in around 90% of the UK&apos;s homes, so the odds are in your favour.</p>
<p><img  id="LjLSChGcLAPXe7bWyy6TkX" name="" caption="" alt="best broadband deals" src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6055d9b3b185c0b87d5043eec55f7653.jpg" link="" align="" fullscreen=""></p>
<figure class=pull-left><p><img  id="DNfeCrBDAE9DQcs2QTAkrV" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DNfeCrBDAE9DQcs2QTAkrV.jpg" align="left" fullscreen="" class="pull-left"></p></figure>
<h3>What contract length should I go for?</h3>
<p>Standard 12 month contracts used to be the norm, but more and more providers now set their minimum contracts at 18 months. There are two ways to look at this - on one hand, getting a longer contract some times also means that you are guaranteed the initial price for a longer period. So no nasty surprises half way through the term.</p><p>But at the same time, you obviously have less flexibility, being tied in for half a year longer. If you hate the idea of such a long contract, then head back up to our comparison chart and use the filter to see only year-long deals. There will be fewer to choose from, but there are still excellent prices to be had.</p>
<p><img  id="LjLSChGcLAPXe7bWyy6TkX" name="" caption="" alt="best broadband deals" src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6055d9b3b185c0b87d5043eec55f7653.jpg" link="" align="" fullscreen=""></p>
<figure class=pull-left><p><img  id="cWa6GeFXBfDAQqfaZumGUm" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cWa6GeFXBfDAQqfaZumGUm.jpg" align="left" fullscreen="" class="pull-left"></p></figure>
<h3>Will I have to pay anything upfront for fibre broadband?</h3>
<p>Most providers ask for at least something when you take up their fibre broadband deal. This will usually be an activation fee, which covers the cost of getting you hooked up. There may also be an additional delivery charge to pay to get hold of your new router. In most cases, expect to pay between &#xA3;10 and &#xA3;60, although the likes of TalkTalk and Plusnet often run offers where they scrap all upfront costs.</p>
<p><img  id="LjLSChGcLAPXe7bWyy6TkX" name="" caption="" alt="best broadband deals" src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6055d9b3b185c0b87d5043eec55f7653.jpg" link="" align="" fullscreen=""></p>

<h3>Do I have to pay more to have a phone line?</h3>
<p>Nope, all of the prices in our comparison chart include the land line. Providers used to specify how much you were paying for the phone line and internet separately, but now it&apos;s standard practice just to bundle them up together and give one single price. We welcome this change, as it makes the whole buying process a lot more straightforward. Having the phone line allows you to make calls if you still use a landline, and the basic price sometimes includes free or cheap weekend calls. If you want to add any other usage packages, you can use our comparison table to find more options, like evening, anytime and international calls.</p>

<h3>BT Infinity broadband</h3>
<p>For most people, BT will still be the first name that springs to mind when they think of broadband. Infinity is the of its fibre broadband packages - choose from the following options:</p><p><strong>BT Unlimited Infinity 1 | Up to 52Mb</strong><br>
The maximum 52Mb download speed (around 6.5 MB per second) from BT Infinity 1 is faster than most other providers&apos; entry-level fibre broadband. You also get the rangey <a href="http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/networking-and-wi-fi/modem-routers/bt-smart-hub-1325372/review">BT Smart Hub</a> router, instead of BT&apos;s standard Home Hub.</p><p><strong>BT Unlimited Infinity 2 | Up to 76Mb</strong><br>
Fast enough to keep up with downloading and streaming from multiple members of your household. It doesn&apos;t come cheap, but does include 500GB of cloud storage, the Smart Hub and usually a very generous prepaid Reward Card to spend as you would a Mastercard.</p><p><strong>View all </strong><a href="http://www.mobiles4everyone.com/linkbb.asp?siteid=future&amp;dealid=bt92&amp;postcode=" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><strong>BT Infinity broadband deals</strong></a></p>

<a  href="http://www.mobiles4everyone.com/linkbb.asp?siteid=future&amp;dealid=skyx603&amp;postcode=" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><figure class=pull-left><p><img  id="SEnrvJsUJXry9HiMi99U7B" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SEnrvJsUJXry9HiMi99U7B.png" align="left" fullscreen="" class="pull-left"></p></figure></a>
<h3>Sky fibre broadband</h3>
<p>On the face of it, the TV giant&apos;s basic Sky Fibre package looks like an amazing price. But beware - you&apos;re limited to only 25GB of data every month. See what else is on offer:</p><p><strong>Sky Fibre | Up to 38Mb | 25GB data limit</strong><br>
 Sky Fibre offers a competitive price point if you want fast broadband but don&apos;t do a great deal of downloading or streaming. You&apos;re limited to 25GB per month, but that&apos;s plenty for dealing with emails and generally browsing the web.</p><p><strong>Sky Fibre Unlimited | Up to 38Mb</strong><br>
 Costing around a tenner more than Sky Fibre, Unlimited gives you exactly what it says on the tin - there are no restrictions at all on how much you use the internet with this plan.</p><p><strong>Sky Fibre Max | Up to 76Mb</strong><br>
 Sky&apos;s premium broadband plan throws in some extras to justify the increased price. The 76Mb (around 9.5MB per second) maximum speed matches most of the fastest fibre plans around (Virgin excepted) and you get a <a href="http://www.techradar.com/reviews/audio-visual/digital-tv-recorders/sky-q-1309215/review">Sky Q Hub</a> router for free.</p><p><strong>View all </strong><a href="http://www.mobiles4everyone.com/linkbb.asp?siteid=future&amp;dealid=skyx603&amp;postcode=" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><strong>Sky Fibre broadband deals</strong></a></p>
<p><img  id="iCwTVcjFaBFnAwTsQoqNJa" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iCwTVcjFaBFnAwTsQoqNJa.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen=""></p>
<a  href="http://www.mobiles4everyone.com/linkbb.asp?siteid=future&amp;dealid=vir82&amp;postcode=" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><figure class=pull-left><p><img  id="8nRkyQW8nQRDU9MjZNB4XE" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8nRkyQW8nQRDU9MjZNB4XE.png" align="left" fullscreen="" class="pull-left"></p></figure></a>
<h3>Virgin Media fibre optics broadband</h3>
<p>Virgin Media cable broadband offers unparalleled internet speeds - no other provider can touch even its entry-level package. You can choose from:</p><p><strong>VIVID 50 fibre broadband | Up to 50Mb</strong> &#xA0;Virgin is now available for less than &#xA3;30 a month thanks to new VIVID 50. So look at our postcode checker above to see if it&apos;s available on your street.&#xA0;&#xA0;</p><p><strong>VIVID 100 fibre broadband | Up to 100Mb</strong><br>
You&apos;ll need to pay over &#xA3;30 to get Virgin&apos;s cheapest broadband package. But you&apos;re unlikely to feel too shortchanged with the connection speeds. &#xA0;The 100Mb claimed speed translates to 12.5 MB per second.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>VIVID 200 fibre broadband</strong> <strong>| Up to 200Mb</strong><br>
As Virgin proudly points out, VIVID 200 more than doubles the maximum speed supplied by BT Infinity and Sky Fibre&apos;s fastest speed. The ultrafast 200Mb speed is a good fit if you stream 4K films and if there are 10 or so devices connected at once.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>VIVID 200 Gamer | Up to 200Mb</strong><br>
There&apos;s more than just the &apos;boss-level broadband&apos; tagline that should appeal to gamers about this fibre package. Pay an extra fiver from the standard VIVID 200 to bag up to 20Mb upload speeds - handy for online gaming. And you don&apos;t have to worry about online traffic management that can slow you down at peak times.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>VIVID 300 fibre broadband | Up to 200Mb</strong><br>
Home broadband speeds in the UK don&apos;t come faster than those provided by Virgin&apos;s VIVID 300 fibre plan. It costs more than &#xA3;40 a month, but you get speeds of up to 37.5MB per second. Extremely rapid.</p><p><strong>View all </strong><a href="http://www.mobiles4everyone.com/linkbb.asp?siteid=future&amp;dealid=vir82&amp;postcode=" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><strong>Virgin Media fibre broadband deals</strong></a></p>

<h3>TalkTalk fibre broadband</h3>
<p>TalkTalk frequently manages to come up with brilliant, cheap deals on fibre broadband. The added bonus...it doesn&apos;t charge an activation fee when you sign up:</p><p><strong>TalkTalk Faster Fibre</strong> <strong>| Up to 38Mb</strong><br>
The price for TalkTalk&apos;s entry-level fibre broadband includes your phone line and set-up. Unlike most other providers, you can choose your contract length: 12, 18 or 24 months.</p><p><strong>TalkTalk Faster Fibre &#xA0;Broadband with Speed Boost</strong> <strong>| Up to 76Mb</strong><br>
TalkTalk&apos;s superfast broadband offering is one of the most competitively priced, and the absence of a set-up fee only sweetens the deal. This is the TalkTalk plan to go for if you have a multitude of data-hungry folk in your home.</p><p><strong>View all </strong><a href="http://www.mobiles4everyone.com/linkbb.asp?siteid=future&amp;dealid=tlk238&amp;postcode=" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><strong>TalkTalk fibre broadband deals</strong></a></p>

<h3>Plusnet fibre broadband</h3>
<p>Although Plusnet is owned by BT, it is continuing to operate in its own right and tends to be more affordable than its parent company. It has two broadband options:</p><p><strong>Plusnet Unlimited Fibre | Up to 38Mb</strong><br>
Choose between a 12 and 18 month contract for Plusnet Unlimited Fibre, and get unlimited usage, 365 days a year support and a Plusnet Hub One router delivered to your door for free.</p><p><strong>Plusnet Unlimited Fibre Extra | Up to 76Mb</strong><br>
The same, only much faster! Take the Unlimited Fibre package above and double the download speed.</p><p><strong>View all </strong><a href="http://www.mobiles4everyone.com/linkbb.asp?siteid=future&amp;dealid=plu128&amp;postcode=" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><strong>Plusnet fibre broadband deals</strong></a></p>

<h3>EE fibre broadband</h3>
<p>A name more commonly associated with mobile phones, the UK&apos;s fastest 4G network is trying to make EE your one stop shop for landline broadband too. You can choose from:</p><p><strong>EE Fibre Broadband | Up to 38Mb</strong><br>
 EE fibre broadband prices are quite attractive, but even more so if you&apos;re already a phone customer. Then, you&apos;ll be granted an extra 5GB of monthly data allowance on your mobile contract.</p><p><strong>EE Fibre Plus Broadband | Up to 76Mb</strong><br>
 It will cost you an extra few pounds to crank up the speed to EE&apos;s fastest Fibre Plus Broadband. Like the entry-level package, you get a free subscription to Norton antivirus and the option to upgrade to EE TV.</p><p><strong>View all </strong><a href="http://www.mobiles4everyone.com/linkbb.asp?siteid=future&amp;dealid=ee1&amp;postcode=" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><strong>EE fibre broadband deals</strong></a></p>

<h3>Vodafone fibre broadband</h3>
<p>Another name more familiar in the mobile phone world, name more commonly associated with mobile phones, but there are excellent prices to be had - whether or not you&apos;re a Vodfone customer:</p><p><strong>Vodafone Unlimited Fibre 38 | Up to 38Mb</strong><br>
You may have previously found that Vodafone&apos;s prices were a little on the high side, unless you already had your mobile phone with the network. But that&apos;s all changed! Now, ALL new broadband customers get the benefit of Vodafone&apos;s cheapest internet prices.</p><p><strong>Vodafone Unlimited Fibre 76 | Up to 76Mb</strong><br>
Faster broadband but the same competitive pricing makes Vodafone a very enticing option if you want 76Mb - regardless of whether you&apos;re already committed to the red network.</p><p><strong>View all </strong><a href="http://www.mobiles4everyone.com/linkbb.asp?siteid=future&amp;dealid=voda301&amp;postcode=" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><strong>Vodafone fibre broadband deals</strong></a></p>

<h3>SSE fibre broadband</h3>
<p>Already one of the &apos;Big Six&apos; energy companies, SSE is now offering cheap prices on fibre broadband. As you might expect, the prices get good if you use SSE as your energy supplier.</p><p><strong>SSE Superfast Fibre Broadband | Up to 38Mb</strong><br>
SSE doesn&apos;t have a 72Mb option, so you&apos;ll have to go elsewhere. But the 4.75MB per second broadband speed will still be ample for most small households and deliver seamless surfing and streaming. Existing SSE energy customers get an automatic &#xA3;25 credit on their next bill and there&apos;s a 25% saving to be made on an additional landline phone package.</p><p><strong>View </strong><a href="http://www.mobiles4everyone.com/linkbb.asp?siteid=future&amp;dealid=sse103&amp;postcode=" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><strong>SSE Superfast Fibre Broadband</strong></a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<h3>Sky broadband plans compared - what broadband speed can I get with Sky?</h3>
<p>Even before you start thinking about whether you want to add Sky TV or mobile to your internet package, you&apos;ll need to decide what speed and data usage best suits your household. Consider whether you want to crank up the speed - and price - with a <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/fibre-broadband-deals">fibre broadband package</a>.</p>
<p><img  id="9mtmJpnJDRjvZhRJk7DUYL" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9mtmJpnJDRjvZhRJk7DUYL.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen=""></p>

<p><strong>Sky Broadband Unlimited</strong></p><p>If you simply want basic broadband for checking your emails and using the web, then Sky&apos;s entry-level Broadband Unlimited deal is one of the cheapest on the market. With download speeds of up to 17Mb (that&apos;s around 2.1MB per second) it may struggle a little with streaming, especially if there are lots of devices trying to use it at once. Sky Broadband Unlimited includes:</p>
<ul ><li>Up to 17Mb speed</li><li>Sky Hub router</li><li>Unlimited data usage</li><li>Sky Broadband Shield and McAfee security trial</li></ul>
<p><img  id="9mtmJpnJDRjvZhRJk7DUYL" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9mtmJpnJDRjvZhRJk7DUYL.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen=""></p>
<p><strong>Sky Fibre</strong></p><p>You can potentially more than double your speeds by going for Sky Fibre - that&apos;s assuming fibre optic broadband is available on your road. But be warned...you&apos;re limited to use only 25GB of data per month. So you&apos;ll have to be careful to ration the amount of box sets you stream and music you download. Sky Fibre includes:</p>
<ul ><li>Up to 38Mb speed</li><li>Sky Hub router</li><li>25GB per month data limit</li><li>Sky Broadband Shield and McAfee security trial</li></ul>
<p><img  id="9mtmJpnJDRjvZhRJk7DUYL" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9mtmJpnJDRjvZhRJk7DUYL.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen=""></p>
<p>&#xA0;<strong>Sky Fibre Unlimited</strong></p><p>The name&apos;s a bit of a giveaway. Take the Sky Fibre package and make the data usage unlimited. It&apos;s quite a big jump in price and you&apos;ll be tied into an 18 month contract, but if you&apos;ve got a data hungry household that are all simultaneously downloading, streaming and browsing, you&apos;ll be glad of the extra speed. Sky Fibre Unlimited includes:</p>
<ul ><li>Up to 38Mb speed</li><li>Sky Hub router</li><li>Unlimited data usage</li><li>Sky Broadband Shield and McAfee security trial</li></ul>
<p><img  id="9mtmJpnJDRjvZhRJk7DUYL" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9mtmJpnJDRjvZhRJk7DUYL.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen=""></p>
<p>&#xA0;<strong>Sky Fibre Max</strong></p><p>This is the daddy of the Sky broadband family. The provider cranks up the speed to up to 76Mb, which could give download speeds of roughly&#xA0;9.5MB per second. Rapid. Plus it throws in the more powerful Sky Q Hub instead of the regular router. Sky Fibre Max includes:</p>
<ul ><li>Up to 76Mb speed</li><li>Sky Q Hub router</li><li>Unlimited data usage</li><li>Sky Broadband Shield and McAfee security trial</li></ul>

<h3>Can I add any Sky TV packages deals?</h3>
<p>When you sign up for Sky broadband, the sales pitch for Sky TV quickly follows. Each comes with a Sky Q box, which lets you record up to 1TB worth of programming - that&apos;s around 500 hours - and you can choose from the following bundles:</p><p><strong>Original</strong> Sky&apos;s most affordable TV bundle throws in more than 270 channels, including Sky Atlantic, Sky 1 and Sky Living.</p><p><strong>Variety </strong>If there are kids in the household, an extra tenner bags thousands of on-demand episodes of children&apos;s TV. &#xA0;It takes the channel count to over the 300 mark, with documentary stations like Discovery and National Geographic, as well as two Eurosport channels.</p><p><strong>Box Sets</strong> If you spend your evenings binging on box sets, Sky&apos;s priciest starter bundle gives you immediate access to more than 350. That&apos;s on top of the 350 channels you&apos;ll get.</p><p>Once you&apos;ve chosen your starter bundle, you can begin adding more bespoke services. If you want Sky Sports, you&apos;ll be looking at almost an extra &#xA3;30, while the suite of Sky Cinema channels is around &#xA3;20.&#xA0;</p>

<h3>What Sky Hub router will I get?</h3>
<p>Depending on what Sky broadband plan you go for, you&apos;ll be sent one of two different routers:</p><p><strong>Sky Hub </strong>The standard wireless Sky Hub router should be good enough to provide a sufficient signal to the household. But it may not quite have the oomph to support a strong signal to every corner of larger houses.</p><p><strong>Sky Q Hub</strong> It may be a little bit chunkier than the ordinary Sky Hub, but that translates into a more powerful router. If you&apos;re desperate for fast downloads, it connect to 5GHz channels and it has the capacity to connect 64 laptops, tablets, phones and other devices. If you&apos;re hankering for the Sky Q Hub but aren&apos;t intending to go for Sky Fibre Max, you can pay extra to upgrade.</p>

<h3>How long will my Sky broadband contract last?</h3>
<p>If you go for Sky&apos;s most affordable Broadband Unlimited plan, you&apos;ll get a one year contract. With all of the Fibre packages, you&apos;ll be tied into an 18 month commitment to Sky. You may not wish to be tied into a contract that long, but at least you&apos;ll know what you&apos;ll be paying for longer.</p>

<h3>Sky Talk - do I get a Sky phone line?</h3>
<p>The price you pay for Sky Broadband also includes Sky Line Rental, which lets you retain your existing home phone number.</p><p>You can pay an extra premium for a Sky Talk allowance - for example, Sky Talk Evenings and Weekends allows unlimited &#xA0;calls during those windows (evenings are defined as 7pm-7am), Sky Talk Anytime Extra for as many calls as you wish to UK landlines at any time and Sky Talk International Extra if you have friends or family living overseas.</p>

<h3>Do I get Sky email?</h3>
<p>If you want it, you&apos;ll be assigned with a Sky Yahoo! Mail account. You can access this email account on any computer, smartphone or tablet - not just your home PC or laptop.</p>

<h3>What broadband speed do I need?</h3>
<p>Superfast fibre broadband may sound appetising, but it may not be necessary for your home - especially if you want to cut costs. It could be worth considering slower, cheaper ADSL instead.</p><p>Broadband speeds are represented in megabits per second, or Mb. Crudely speaking, the more Mbs, the faster the broadband speed. But remember that the advertised speed is the maximum and doesn&apos;t necessarily represent the actual speed you&apos;ll end up getting. That varies depending where you live.</p><p><strong>0-25Mb</strong> This entry-level broadband speed is transmitted via an ADSL connection to your nearest BT exchange. The equivalent to around 2.1MB per second, It should be fast enough for small households where only one or two people are using the internet at once. Be aware that if you stream TV, you may experience the odd interruption.</p><p><strong>25-50Mb </strong>Where Virgin led the way, the rest followed. Now every big provider offers rapid fibre broadband. This is the sweet spot between fast speeds and good value and just the ticket for a family household where four or five members are all streaming, downloading and surfing at once.</p><p><strong>50+Mb </strong>If you stream 4K TV or have loads of people trying to use your broadband connection at once, then it may be worth shelling out for the extra speed. It may cost you more, but you&apos;re pretty much guaranteed lag-free use - plus, the providers often sweeten the deal with added extras and rewards.</p>

<h3>Is fibre broadband available in my area?</h3>
<p>There&apos;s one very easy way to find out...scroll to the top of this page and input your postcode. We&apos;ll tell you straight away whether you can get fast fibre broadband.</p><p>Roughly speaking, 90% of UK homes now have the option of connecting to fibre broadband. But if you have your heart on Virgin Media fibre plans, it&apos;s more like around 60%.</p>
<p><img  id="LjLSChGcLAPXe7bWyy6TkX" name="" caption="" alt="best broadband deals" src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6055d9b3b185c0b87d5043eec55f7653.jpg" link="" align="" fullscreen=""></p>
<h3>What contract length should I go for?</h3>
<p>Most broadband providers lock you in for at least 12 months, with one year plans being by far the most common. &#xA0;That said, perhaps taking their cue from mobile phone contracts, we are now seeing some providers experimenting with longer plans, with 18 month contracts rearing their heads.</p><p>On the opposite side of the spectrum, some providers now offer short term rolling contracts. Virgin Media, for example, have 30 day plans for commitment-phobes. The downside is you&apos;ll be expected to play a larger setup fee.</p><p>When your contract comes to an end, be prepared for your monthly tariff to be hiked - especially if you were lucky enough to get a great introductory offer at the outset.</p>
<p><img  id="LjLSChGcLAPXe7bWyy6TkX" name="" caption="" alt="best broadband deals" src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6055d9b3b185c0b87d5043eec55f7653.jpg" link="" align="" fullscreen=""></p>
<h3>Will I have to pay anything upfront for broadband?</h3>
<p>Usually. Sometimes known as &apos;setup&apos;, &apos;upfront&apos; or &apos;activation&apos; fees, most of the major broadband providers ask for at least some payment when you kick off your contract. The amount usually depends on what level of package you go for, but it will likely be somewhere between &#xA3;10 and &#xA3;60. Only TalkTalk bucks the trend - they&apos;ve scrapped their activation fee completely, while other brands run frequent promotions where they temporarily scrap their upfront cost.</p><p>There may be other added extras, too, however. If you take a broadband and TV package, you might be charged for the TV set-top box. And some, including BT and EE, charge delivery for the router.</p>

<h3>Do I have to pay more to have a phone line?</h3>
<p>If you still use a home landline to make and receive calls, you&apos;re in luck - many broadband plans don&apos;t &#xA0;just feature a landline, but they actually include it in your monthly price.</p><p>You will have to start paying more though when you have a personalised call plan. You&apos;ll see your standard monthly bill begin to escalate when you start adding unlimited evening, daytime or international calls to the mix.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Take a look at the item description for more info on refurbs. <em>Personally speaking, I bought an older refurbished Xbox One from Tesco&apos;s eBay in late 2015 at a seriously discounted price and it looked brand new, so I have no problems recommending this deal.</em></p><p><strong>View this Xbox One deal: </strong><a href="http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/291991181176" target="_blank"><strong>Xbox One S &#xA3;165 @ Tesco&apos;s eBay</strong></a></p>

<p><strong>Xbox One S | Battlefield 1 | &#xA3;229.99 @ Tesco</strong><br>
The Battlefield 1 Xbox One S bundle isn&apos;t a fan of lowering it&apos;s price, as it frequently hovers around the &#xA3;250 mark.

      <title>It looks increasingly likely that the Google Pixel 2 will drop the headphone jack</title>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.techradar.com/news/google-pixel-2-will-have-no-headphone-jack-further-confirmation</guid>
      <description>A new leak about the Pixel 2 has hammered another nail in the coffin of the headphone jack.</description>
      <pubDate>Fri, 04 Aug 2017 10:17:20 +0000</pubDate>
      <source url="http://www.techradar.com">techradar.com</source>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The biggest talking point around the upcoming <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/google-pixel-2">Google Pixel 2</a> and it&#x2019;s bigger sibling, the Pixel 2 XL, is whether the handsets will drop the headphone jack, and we&apos;ve got yet more rumors suggesting it&apos;s time to pour one out for the 3.5mm port.</p><p>A tweet shared by managing editor of 9to5Google Stephen Hall, further solidifies the current thinking that Google will drop the headphone jack on the Pixel 2 (and 2 XL), in favor of Bluetooth connectivity and the USB Type-C port for connection to audio devices.</p><p>In a follow up tweet he says that he is basing this information on having &#x201C;seen both internal documentation and been told by someone who has seen protos&#x201D;. That&apos;s prototypes in case you don&apos;t know the abbreviation.</p>
<h3>End of 3.5mm?</h3>
<p>This news doesn&#x2019;t come as much of a surprise to anyone who has been keeping an eye on the Pixel 2 rumors, given that CAD designs a little over a week ago showed no sign of the 3.5mm port, and case designs that have recently surfaced show no hole to plug in your headphones.</p><p>While an unpopular move when Apple removed the port from the <a href="http://www.techradar.com/reviews/phones/mobile-phones/iphone-7-1327947/review">iPhone 7</a>, it does make sense in terms of device real-estate, where every inch of the handset is valuable for spreading spreading internals.&#xA0;</p><p>If there is a port that is capable of doubling up, it doesn&#x2019;t make sense to have two ports taking up valuable space that could be filled with battery or chips.&#xA0;</p><p>Of course, Apple isn&apos;t the only manufacturer that&apos;s dropped the jack, with the <a href="http://www.techradar.com/reviews/htc-u11-review">HTC U11</a> and the <a href="http://www.techradar.com/reviews/phones/mobile-phones/moto-z-1323027/review">Moto Z</a> also doing so. If Google does drop it, this could be significant for the future of the 3.5mm in general.</p><p>As this is just a rumor, we have yet to get official confirmation about the status of the audio output from Google. As soon as we know for definite, you&#x2019;ll know.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You might be able to manage without a spreadsheet application or a tool for making slideshows, but everyone needs a good word processor. Thankfully, there&#x2019;s no need to pay for this essential software &#x2013; there are excellent tools available to download and use completely free.</p><p>Here we&#x2019;re looking at the very best word processors that can be used offline (particularly useful for distraction-free writing), but there are also several excellent browser-based tools to consider if you&apos;d rather do your writing online.</p><p><a href="https://docs.google.com" target="_blank">Google Docs</a> is the most obvious choice, and has the advantage of saving your work automatically so you don&#x2019;t have to worry if your connection fails. It&#x2019;s also a good choice for collaborative working, and means you don&#x2019;t have to upload work to a separate cloud storage service. However, it has a limited selection of templates, there&#x2019;s no way to import content from other Google applications, and any online tool is going to be surrounded by distractions like social media.</p><p>If you&apos;d prefer an offline word processor, read on &#x2013; the perfect one is only a click away.</p>

<h3>1. <a href="http://www.techradar.com/reviews/wps-office-free">WPS Office Writer</a></h3>
<p><strong>The best free word processor, with cloud storage and support for all text files</strong></p><p>If you&#x2019;ve used a modern version of Microsoft Word, there&#x2019;ll be no learning curve at all when you switch to Writer &#x2013;&#xA0;the word processing component of <a href="http://www.techradar.com/reviews/wps-office-free">WPS Office Free</a>.</p><p>This free word processor looks and behaves almost exactly like its premium counterpart, and even has its own equivalent of <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/internet/cloud-services/best-cloud-storage-dropbox-vs-skydrive-vs-google-drive-vs-icloud-1120024" title="OneDrive" data-atoaf="true" >OneDrive</a>, offering 1GB free cloud storage.</p>
<p>Its selection of pre-installed templates gives you everything you need for common document types, and you can easily create your own for bespoke tasks. It&#x2019;s compatible with every text file format you can think of, including current and legacy versions of Microsoft Word dating back to Office 97.</p><p>WPS Office Writer is supported by discrete ads, which can be removed by upgrading to the premium version, but they&#x2019;re barely noticeable and no features are locked behind a paywall. Overall, WPS Writer is very impressive, and in our opinion it&#x2019;s the best free word processor available to download today.</p><p>WPS has just launched <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/the-best-free-pdf-to-word-converter">a free PDF to Word converter</a> as well, which is a great companion for its word processor.</p><p><strong>Review and where to download: </strong><a href="http://www.techradar.com/reviews/wps-office-free"><strong>WPS Office Free</strong></a></p>

<h3>&#xA0;2. <a href="http://www.techradar.com/reviews/libreoffice">LibreOffice</a> or <a href="http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/software/business-and-finance-software/apache-openoffice-4-0-1171091/review">Apache OpenOffice Writer</a>&#xA0;</h3>
<p><strong>All-singing, all-dancing word processors for any kind of text-based work</strong></p><p><a href="http://www.techradar.com/reviews/libreoffice">LibreOffice</a> is a fork of <a href="http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/software/business-and-finance-software/apache-openoffice-4-0-1171091/review">Apache OpenOffice</a>, and although there are some differences between the two suites (LibreOffice receives more frequent updates, for example, and has a more lively userbase), their word processing components are so similar, we&#x2019;re listing them together.</p>
<p>Both versions of Writer are feature-packed analogs of Microsoft Word, packed with all the features you could possibly need for any text-based work.&#xA0;</p><p>The two versions of Writer include wizards and templates for common document types, such as invoices and letters, and it&#x2019;s easy to create your own templates for future use as well. The word processors also work together with the other office software in their respective suites &#x2013; so you can use Base to create a bibliography, for example.</p><p>Both word processors support all the most popular file formats, and can export documents to PDF without the need for additional software. If you&#x2019;re looking for a word processor that can stand in for Microsoft Word, either of these two will be a perfect candidate.</p><p><strong>Review and where to download: </strong><a href="http://www.techradar.com/reviews/libreoffice"><strong>LibreOffice</strong></a></p><p><strong>Review and where to download: </strong><a href="http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/software/business-and-finance-software/apache-openoffice-4-0-1171091/review"><strong>Apache OpenOffice</strong></a></p>

<h3>3. <a href="http://www.techradar.com/reviews/focuswriter">FocusWriter</a></h3>
<p><strong>The ideal word processor for first drafts, with no fussy formatting</strong></p><p>If you simply want to hammer out some words without worrying about formatting, you could just use Windows&#x2019; built-in Notepad app, but <a href="http://www.techradar.com/reviews/focuswriter">FocusWriter</a> is full of clever tools that will help you maximize productivity without ever getting in the way.</p>
<p>As the name implies, FocusWriter blocks out all distractions so you can give that all-important first draft your full attention. In normal use, all you see is a blank page &#x2013; toolbars are only visible if you move your mouse pointer to the edge of the screen &#x2013; but there&#x2019;s a killer feature in Focused Text, which fades everything into the background except the current paragraph or sentence.</p><p>FocusWriter also features alerts that are triggered at certain times, or when you&#x2019;ve reached a predefined word count, so you don&#x2019;t need to worry about watching a counter (as you would in Microsoft Word). This also makes FocusWriter a good tool to use in tandem with <a href="https://cirillocompany.de/pages/pomodoro-technique" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">the Pomodoro Technique</a>, which involves working hard for a period of time that&#x2019;s long enough for you to work productively, but not so long that you become fatigued.</p><p>It&#x2019;s not suitable for editing, but for productivity, FocusWriter is hard to beat.</p><p><strong>Review and where to download: </strong><a href="http://www.techradar.com/reviews/focuswriter"><strong>FocusWriter</strong></a></p>

<h3>4. <a href="http://downloads.techradar.com/downloads/softmaker-freeoffice">SoftMaker FreeOffice TextMaker</a></h3>
<p><strong>Another great looking word processor, but it can&apos;t save in DOCX format</strong></p><p><a href="http://downloads.techradar.com/downloads/softmaker-freeoffice">TextMaker</a> &#x2013; the word processing element of SoftMaker FreeOffice &#x2013; is good looking, and comes with several handy templates for creating letters and other everyday documents. The selection isn&#x2019;t as extensive as some of its rivals&#x2019;, but you can also make new designs for future use and save them in TMV format.</p>
<p>All the features you&#x2019;d expect from a modern word processor are present and correct, including advanced formatting options, the ability to create databases for managing bibliographies and footnotes, and a function for tracking changes to collaborative projects.</p><p>The only real drawback of TextMaker is its inability to save your work in DOCX format (though you can open and edit these files with no difficulty). This feature is limited to the premium version of SoftMaker Office, which retails for &#xA3;48.20 (about US$60, AU$75).&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Download here: </strong><a href="http://downloads.techradar.com/downloads/softmaker-freeoffice"><strong>SoftMaker FreeOffice</strong></a></p>

<h3>5. <a href="http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/software/utilities/writemonkey-review-1325869/review">WriteMonkey</a></h3>
<p><strong>Productivity-focused word processing with quick keyboard shortcuts</strong></p><p><a href="http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/software/utilities/writemonkey-review-1325869/review">WriteMonkey</a> is another no-frills word processor designed to help you maximize your output without fussing with editing and formatting. It&#x2019;s not intended for documents like letters or CVs, but is great for committing early ideas to paper (or screen) so you have the raw material to develop later.</p>
<p>Unlike FocusWriter, which is compatible with all the most common text formats (including Microsoft&#x2019;s DOC and DOCX), WriteMonkey only works with TXT files, so you&#x2019;ll have to convert any works in progress before opening them. WriteMonkey&#x2019;s hidden controls are tricker to navigate, too &#x2013; everything is accessed via a large right-click menu, or a vast collection of keyboard shortcuts.</p><p>That said, if you&#x2019;re happy to commit those shortcuts to memory, you&#x2019;ll find WriteMonkey faster to use than toolbar-based alternatives.</p><p>We also like the ability to look words up in Wikipedia, Google Images, Poetry.com, Answers.com, and many others without opening a browser winder manually and leaving yourself open to the temptations of Twitter and Facebook.</p><p>WriteMonkey is a portable app, so there&#x2019;s no need to install it &#x2013; just extract all the downloaded files to a removable drive or cloud storage service, and you can use it on any PC by opening the file WriteMonkey.exe.</p><p><strong>Review and where to download: </strong><a href="http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/software/utilities/writemonkey-review-1325869/review"><strong>WriteMonkey</strong></a></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>With crowdsourcing, AI and supercomputers working in parallel.</description>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Google has become very interested in artificial intelligence in recent years, and particularly its applications for regular people. For example, <a href="https://aiexperiments.withgoogle.com/" target="_blank"><ins>here&apos;s a load of experiments</ins></a> that it&apos;s running involving machine learning.</p><p>Now, however, researchers at the Texas Advanced Computing Center have shown how artificial intelligence techniques can also deliver better search engine results. They&apos;ve combined AI, crowdsourcing and supercomputers to develop a better system for information extraction and classification.</p><p>At the 2017 Annual Meeting for the Association of Computational Linguistics in Vancouver this week, associate professor Matthew Lease led a team presenting two papers that described a new kind of informational retrieval system.</p>
<h3>Intelligent systems</h3>
<p>&quot;An important challenge in natural language processing is accurately finding important information contained in free-text, which lets us extract it into databases and combine it with other data in order to make more intelligent decisions and new discoveries,&quot; Lease said.&#xA0;</p><p>&quot;We&apos;ve been using crowdsourcing to annotate medical and news articles at scale so that our intelligent systems will be able to more accurately find the key information contained in each article.&quot;</p><p>They were able to use that crowdsourced data to train a neural network to predict the names of things, and extract useful information from texts that aren&apos;t annotated at all.&#xA0;</p><p>In the second paper, they showed how to weight different linguistic resources so that the automatic text classification is better. &quot;Neural network models have tons of parameters and need lots of data to fit them,&quot; said Lease.</p>
<h3>Consistently better results</h3>
<p>In testing on both biomedical searches and movie reviews, the system delivered consistently better results than methods that didn&apos;t involve weighting the data.</p><p>&quot;We had this idea that if you could somehow reason about some words being related to other words a priori, then instead of having to have a parameter for each one of those word separately, you could tie together the parameters across multiple words and in that way need less data to learn the model,&quot; said Lease.</p><p>He added: &quot;Industry is great at looking at near-term things, but they don&apos;t have the same freedom as academic researchers to pursue research ideas that are higher risk but could be more transformative in the long-term.&quot;</p>

      <title>You may have to wait three weeks after launch to buy the Galaxy Note 8</title>

      <description>The Samsung Galaxy Note 8 release date could be some time after its expected August 23 launch.</description>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/samsung-galaxy-note-8">Galaxy Note 8</a> is set to launch on August 23 at a Samsung Unpacked event in New York, but the wait to actually buy the phone may continue for almost a month.</p><p>A new rumor from analysts suggests the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 release date won&apos;t be until September 15.</p><p>A South Korean carrier spokesperson is also quoted in a news story from site <a href="http://english.etnews.com/20170802200002" target="_blank">ETNews</a> who said, &quot;We are going to sell Galaxy Note 8 starting from the 15th of September. Its price has not been set yet&quot;.</p>
<h3>Near the iPhone 8</h3>
<p>Previous rumors for the Note 8 launch suggested the phone would be up for pre-order from <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/this-is-the-date-samsung-galaxy-note-8-pre-orders-go-live">August 25 in Australia</a> and that may still be the case.&#xA0;</p><p>It just means if you pre-order the phone in August you&apos;ll have to wait a few weeks until you receive it.</p><p>A three week wait from launch to on sale may be a little frustrating for some, but it should mean the Note 8 beats the <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/iphone-8-1329124">iPhone 8</a> or <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/iphone-7s-release-date-news-and-rumors">iPhone 7S</a> to market as that&apos;s expected to launch in mid-September or even a little later in the year.</p>

      <title>iPhone 8’s camera could get a big upgrade on both the front and back</title>

      <description>Both the front and rear cameras on the iPhone 8 could be capable of shooting 4K footage at 60fps.</description>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Another day and another nugget of <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/iphone-8-1329124">iPhone 8</a> information has been found in Apple&#x2019;s <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/apple-accidentally-leaked-iphone-8-all-screen-design-and-infrared-face-id">HomePod firmware.</a> This one tells us that the iPhone 8&#x2019;s rear camera could be capable of shooting 4K video at 60fps and, surprisingly, that its front-facing one could too.</p><p>Code spotted by Portuguese news site <a href="https://ihelpbr.com/codigos-internos-do-ios-sugerem-que-camera-do-iphone-8-gravara-videos-em-4k-com-60fps/" target="_blank">iHelp</a> mentions &#x2018;4k60VideoSupported&#x2019; along with the identifiers &#x2018;back&#x2019; and &#x2018;front&#x2019;, strongly suggesting that the video upgrade will apply to both cameras.</p><p>That would be an improvement for the rear camera, which on the <a href="http://www.techradar.com/reviews/phones/mobile-phones/iphone-7-1327947/review">iPhone 7</a> can shoot 4K footage but only at 30fps, and a massive jump for the front-facing camera, which on the iPhone 7 can only shoot video at up to 1080p.</p>

<h3>Better footage in a smaller size</h3>
<p>If you&#x2019;re a budding videographer this could be a big deal, and the code also mentions support for the HEVC file type, which can store content in a much smaller file size. 4K videos tend to eat up a lot of storage space, so that should be useful too if you plan to keep many of them on your iPhone.</p><p>As ever we can&#x2019;t be certain this information is accurate, or even that it&#x2019;s referring to the iPhone 8, but it&#x2019;s seemingly been found in Apple firmware, so there&#x2019;s a good chance it will prove true.</p><p>With other iPhone 8 camera rumors pointing to a dual-lens camera and augmented reality features, along with a clever <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/the-iphone-8-could-have-a-smart-camera-that-knows-what-its-looking-at">&#x2018;SmartCam&#x2019; feature</a> for automatic scene detection, the iPhone 8&#x2019;s camera could well be a huge improvement on the already-impressive iPhone 7 one, and even substantially better than the dual-lens one on the <a href="http://www.techradar.com/reviews/phones/mobile-phones/iphone-7-plus-1327948/review">iPhone 7 Plus</a>.</p><p>We might not even have too long a wait to find out just how good it is as a recent Apple earnings call suggests the iPhone 8 could land in September.</p>
<ul ><li>Will there also be an <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/iphone-8-plus">iPhone 8 Plus</a>?</li></ul>

I don&#39;t know if this is the right sub to post this, but I&#39;ll give it a go.</p> <p>I have a bachelor degree as software developer, but due to stress and depression I have been away from work since May last year. This month I lost my job, as I can&#39;t go back to the workplace, too much triggering. So basically I haven&#39;t done much programming since and I won&#39;t in the near future. I know I should focus on getting better but I worry about loosing my skillset. Should I be worried? I know that coding is a skill you have to train, like riding a bike - the more you do, the better you get. I have a hard time getting motivated for developing something at home, but I know if I had a task for whatever I would do what I can to solve the problem. How do you solve this hurdle? </p> <p>I try to be informed about latest news in different languages. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/kallaen1990"> /u/kallaen1990 </a> &#32; to &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/"> r/webdev </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/7wmmmi/keep_skills_uptodate/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/7wmmmi/keep_skills_uptodate/">[comments]</a></span>',
